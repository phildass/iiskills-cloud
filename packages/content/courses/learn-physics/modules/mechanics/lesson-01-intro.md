# Introduction to Mechanics

Mechanics is the branch of physics that deals with motion and the forces that cause motion.

## Key Concepts

- **Kinematics**: study of motion without considering forces
- **Dynamics**: study of forces and their effects on motion
- **Newton's Laws**: the three fundamental laws governing classical mechanics

## Newton's First Law

An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion, unless acted on by an external force.

## Newton's Second Law

$$F = ma$$

Force equals mass times acceleration.

## Practice Problem

A 5 kg object is pushed with a force of 20 N. What is its acceleration?

*Answer: a = F/m = 20/5 = 4 m/s²*
