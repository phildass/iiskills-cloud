# Monorepo Backup (Frozen Snapshot)

**Date**: 2026-02-24  
**Status**: FROZEN — this directory is a snapshot of the repository as it existed before the monorepo rebuild.

This backup is safe to delete once the new monorepo build (at repo root) is stable and verified.

No attempt has been made to keep this backup buildable.
