# Daily Dev Log – 2026-01-28

## Summary
- Continued Yarn workspace and monorepo debugging for `admin` app.
- Deleted `package-lock.json` and verified only one root `yarn.lock`.
- Attempted workspace detection; observed persistent error.
- Prepared for refactor: plan to move all workspaces into `apps/` directory.

## Next Steps
- Refactor repo for workspace compatibility (move apps, update configs).
- Re-attempt `yarn install` and test builds after structure update.
- Review any agent PRs or Copilot suggestions.
