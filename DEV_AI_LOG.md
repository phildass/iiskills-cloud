# Development AI Session Log

This log tracks all AI/automation agent sessions for handover and continuity.

## Purpose

All AI agents and automation tools working on this repository must update this log with:
- Session date and time
- Agent/tool used (e.g., GitHub Copilot, custom automation)
- Summary of changes made
- Issues addressed
- Next steps or recommendations

## Guidelines for AI Agents

**After completing your changes, append a detailed session summary to this file for future Copilots/agents.**

1. **Date/Time**: When the session occurred
2. **Agent**: Which AI/automation tool was used
3. **Objective**: What issue or task was addressed
4. **Changes**: Detailed list of files modified/created
5. **Testing**: What validation was performed
6. **Status**: Complete, partial, or needs follow-up
