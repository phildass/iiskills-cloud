# Payment Integration: aienter.in → iiskills.cloud

This document describes the **SSO-based payment flow** between iiskills.cloud paid apps and the central payment portal at aienter.in.

---

## Overview

The full payment flow is:

```
User clicks "Pay Now" on <appname>.iiskills.cloud
      │
      ▼
User is redirected to https://iiskills.cloud/payments/iiskills?course=<appId>
(already authenticated — Supabase session checked here)
      │
      ▼
iiskills.cloud POST /api/payments/generate-token
Generates signed JWT with user identity, course slug, and returnTo URL
      │
      ▼
User is redirected to https://aienter.in/payments/iiskills?course=...&token=...&returnTo=...
(token verified by aienter — no login prompt shown)
      │
      ▼
User pays via Razorpay on aienter.in
      │
      ▼
aienter.in POSTs server-to-server to https://iiskills.cloud/api/payments/ai-enter/callback
iiskills.cloud verifies HMAC signature, grants entitlement
      │
      ▼
User is redirected to https://<appname>.iiskills.cloud/authorised
      │
      ▼
/authorised redirects to /complete-registration (set password, fill profile, etc.)
```

> **Key principle**: iiskills.cloud does **not** talk to Razorpay directly. It trusts the
> confirmation only after verifying a shared HMAC-SHA256 secret with aienter.in.

## SSO Token Flow

### Token Generation: `POST /api/payments/generate-token`

When a logged-in user reaches `/payments/iiskills`, iiskills.cloud generates a short-lived JWT:

| Payload field | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `user_id` | Supabase user UUID |
| `email` | User's email address |
| `phone` | User's phone number (from profile) |
| `name` | User's full name (from profile) |
| `course_slug` | App ID of the course being purchased |
| `return_to` | Post-payment redirect URL (`https://<appname>.iiskills.cloud/authorised`) |
| `jti` | Random nonce to prevent replay attacks |

The token is signed with `PAYMENT_TOKEN_SECRET` (HS256) and expires in 10 minutes.

### returnTo URL (per-app)

After a successful payment, aienter.in redirects the user to the `returnTo` URL. This is
derived from the `course` app ID and always points to `https://<appname>.iiskills.cloud/authorised`:

| App ID | returnTo |
|--------|---------|
| `learn-ai` | `https://learn-ai.iiskills.cloud/authorised` |
| `learn-developer` | `https://learn-developer.iiskills.cloud/authorised` |
| `learn-management` | `https://learn-management.iiskills.cloud/authorised` |
| `learn-pr` | `https://learn-pr.iiskills.cloud/authorised` |

The `/authorised` page on each subdomain app shows a payment success message and
immediately redirects to `/complete-registration` to finalise onboarding.

## Callback Endpoint

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **URL** | `POST https://iiskills.cloud/api/payments/ai-enter/callback` |
| **Content-Type** | `application/json` |
| **Auth** | HMAC-SHA256 signature (see below) |

---

## Required Environment Variables

Set these on **iiskills.cloud** (apps/main `.env.local` / server environment):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PAYMENT_TOKEN_SECRET` | Long random string used to sign/verify payment JWT tokens. Generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`. |
| `ORIGIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Shared HMAC secret between aienter.in and iiskills.cloud for server-to-server callback. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Supabase project URL |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Supabase service role key (server-side only, never exposed to browser) |

---

## Request Format

### Headers

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `X-AI-ENTER-SIGNATURE` | **Yes** | HMAC-SHA256 hex digest of the raw request body, keyed with `ORIGIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `Content-Type` | **Yes** | Must be `application/json` |

### Body Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `event` | `string` | **Yes** | Must be `"payment.success"` |
| `razorpay_payment_id` | `string` | **Yes** | Razorpay payment ID — used as idempotency key |
| `app_id` | `string` | **Yes** | iiskills app identifier, e.g. `"learn-ai"` |
| `user_token` | `string` | **Yes (Option A)** | The JWT token issued by `/api/payments/generate-token` |
| `phone` | `string` | **Yes (legacy)** | Required if `user_token` is absent |
| `email` | `string` | No | Customer email (used in legacy flow) |
| `amount` | `number` | No | Payment amount in paise |
| `currency` | `string` | No | Defaults to `"INR"` |

---

## Signature Generation (on aienter.in)

Compute the signature over the **raw request body bytes** (not re-serialized JSON):

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const rawBody = JSON.stringify(payload); // keep as-is; do not re-serialize
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac('sha256', process.env.ORIGIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
  .update(Buffer.from(rawBody, 'utf8'))
  .digest('hex');
```

Send the signature in the `X-AI-ENTER-SIGNATURE` header.

---

## Response Codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200` | Payment confirmed (or already confirmed — idempotent) |
| `400` | Missing/invalid required field |
| `401` | Missing or invalid `X-AI-ENTER-SIGNATURE`, or invalid `user_token` |
| `405` | Non-POST request |
| `500` | Server-side error (Supabase unavailable, etc.) |

---

## Idempotency

iiskills.cloud enforces idempotency via a `UNIQUE` constraint on `razorpay_payment_id` in the
payments table. Sending the same `razorpay_payment_id` more than once returns
HTTP 200 without creating duplicate records.

---

## Security Notes

- The raw body (not re-serialized JSON) **must** be used for HMAC computation on both sides.
- `timingSafeEqual` is used for comparison to prevent timing attacks.
- `ORIGIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is a server-side-only env var — never expose it client-side.
- `PAYMENT_TOKEN_SECRET` is used server-side only to sign/verify JWTs.
- iiskills.cloud does **not** require Razorpay credentials.
- The `returnTo` URL in the JWT payload is authoritative; unsigned query params for `returnTo`
  should not be trusted over the verified token payload.
