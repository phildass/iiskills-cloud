   - Best for users wanting complete account setup
   - Required fields: First Name, Last Name, Gender, Date of Birth, Education Level, Location, State, District, Email, Password

   - Quick simplified registration
   - Perfect if you want to start learning immediately
   - Required fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password

After registration:
1. Check your email inbox
2. Click the confirmation link
3. Your account is now active!

### Step 3: Sign In Anywhere

Now you can sign in to **any** iiskills.cloud app using the same credentials:

**Three Sign-In Methods:**

#### 🔐 Option 1: Email & Password
- Use on any app's login page
- Enter the email and password you registered with
- Click "Sign In"

#### ✨ Option 2: Magic Link (Recommended)
- Click "Use magic link instead" on any login page
- Enter your email address

- **No password needed!**

#### 🚀 Option 3: Google Sign-In

- Works if you registered with Google or linked your Google account

### Step 4: Explore All Apps

Once logged in on one app, you're automatically logged in everywhere!

**Try it:**
1. Login on `iiskills.cloud`
2. Visit `learn-apt.iiskills.cloud` in a new tab
3. You'll already be logged in there too!

## Understanding Universal Authentication

### How It Works

All iiskills.cloud apps connect to the **same user database**. This means:

- Your account information is centralized
- Login on any app creates a session that works everywhere
- Logout on any app logs you out everywhere
- Your progress and preferences sync across all apps

### Registration Differences

Depending on where you register, you'll see different forms:

**Main Site Registration:**
- First Name, Last Name
- Gender, Date of Birth
- Education Level
- Location, State, District
- Email, Password

**Subdomain Registration:**
- First Name, Last Name
- Age (optional)
- Qualification (optional)
- Email, Password

**Both create the same account!** If you register on a subdomain with the simplified form, you can always complete your profile later on the main site.

### Your Session

When you login:
- Your session lasts for 1 week (configurable)
- It automatically refreshes while you're active
- It works across all `*.iiskills.cloud` domains
- You can logout from any app to end the session everywhere

## Common Questions

### Q: I registered on Learn-Apt. Can I access Learn-JEE?
**A:** Yes! Your account works on all iiskills.cloud apps automatically.

### Q: I forgot my password. What should I do?
**A:** You have two easy options:
1. Use the **Magic Link** option on the login page - no password needed!
2. Use **Google Sign-In** if you signed up with Google

### Q: Can I have different accounts for different apps?
**A:** You can, but you don't need to! One account gives you access to everything. Having multiple accounts means managing multiple logins unnecessarily.

### Q: I registered on the main site. Why does Learn-NEET ask me to login?
**A:** Make sure you're using the same email you registered with. If you are and still can't login, please contact support at info@iiskills.cloud.

### Q: Do I need to register again if you add a new app?
**A:** No! Any new apps added to the iiskills.cloud ecosystem will automatically work with your existing account.
