- **Screen Readers:** Semantic HTML with ARIA labels
- **Focus Indicators:** Visible focus states for accessibility
- **Alt Text:** All emoji have text alternatives

---

## Performance

- **Code Splitting:** Dynamic imports for components
- **Lazy Loading:** Images and heavy components load on demand
- **Optimized Gradients:** CSS gradients for performance
- **Minimal JS:** Leverage Next.js for optimal bundle size

---

## Branding Consistency

Both apps share:
- Same typography (Inter, system sans-serif fallback)
- Similar card layouts (glassmorphism)
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Unified button styles (only color differs)
- Same icon style (emoji for accessibility and quick recognition)

Only differences:
- Color scheme (Cyan vs Purple)
- Taglines (Developer-focused vs AI-focused)
- Feature descriptions (tailored to each domain)

This creates a cohesive brand while clearly differentiating the two learning paths.
