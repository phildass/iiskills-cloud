  "module": "Advanced Patterns & Clean Code",
  "summary": "Airbnb's open-source JavaScript Style Guide became the industry standard for ES6+ code style, adopted by millions of developers and projects worldwide.",
  "background": "As Airbnb's engineering team grew, inconsistent code style created friction in code reviews and made onboarding new engineers harder. Manual style enforcement was unscalable.",
  "response": "Airbnb formalised their JavaScript conventions in a detailed style guide and released a custom ESLint configuration (eslint-config-airbnb) to enforce rules automatically.",
  "outcome": "The Airbnb ESLint config became the most popular npm package of its type, with tens of millions of weekly downloads. The style guide has shaped how a generation of developers writes JavaScript.",
  "lessons": [
    "Automated enforcement scales where manual review cannot",
    "Open-sourcing internal tools creates community goodwill",
    "Shared conventions reduce cognitive load in code review",
    "Opinionated defaults enable focus on business logic"
  ],
  "discussion_questions": [
    "What are the trade-offs of adopting an opinionated style guide?",
    "How should teams decide when to deviate from a community standard?"
