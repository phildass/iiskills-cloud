  "content": "<h2>Case Study: GitHub and MySQL Scale</h2><p>GitHub powers one of the world's largest code collaboration platforms, serving tens of millions of developers. Despite NoSQL alternatives, GitHub chose to scale MySQL to meet its needs.</p><h3>Engineering Approach</h3><p>GitHub invested heavily in MySQL tooling: Vitess for horizontal sharding, ProxySQL for connection pooling, and GitHub-Backup for reliable backups. They contributed extensively to the MySQL community.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>GitHub's MySQL cluster handles billions of queries per day with sub-millisecond query times. Their investment in operational expertise allowed them to squeeze extraordinary performance from a relational database.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>The 'right' database is the one your team understands deeply. Operational excellence often beats architectural novelty. Invest in tooling around your chosen database.</p>",
