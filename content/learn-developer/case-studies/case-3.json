  "module": "React Component Architecture",
  "summary": "When Facebook open-sourced React in 2013, its component model and Virtual DOM diffing challenged the prevailing MVC paradigm and ultimately reshaped how the web is built.",
  "background": "Facebook faced a bug in its chat feature: the unread message count would update inconsistently. Traditional MVC bidirectional data flow made the bug difficult to reproduce.",
  "response": "The React team designed a unidirectional data flow model: data flows down through props, events flow up through callbacks. The Virtual DOM made frequent re-renders efficient.",
  "outcome": "React became the most widely used front-end library. Its component model influenced Angular, Vue, Svelte, and virtually every modern front-end framework.",
  "lessons": [
    "Unidirectional data flow simplifies debugging",
    "Composition over inheritance produces flexible UIs",
    "Performance abstractions (Virtual DOM) can simplify developer mental models",
    "Open-sourcing core infrastructure builds ecosystem loyalty"
  ],
  "discussion_questions": [
    "Why did React's component model resonate so strongly with developers?",
    "How has React Hooks changed the component model?"
