  "content": "<h2>Case Study: Netflix Microservices</h2><p>By 2008, Netflix had grown to millions of subscribers but their monolithic architecture struggled to scale. A database corruption incident prompted a complete rethink of their infrastructure strategy.</p><h3>The Migration</h3><p>Netflix gradually decomposed their monolith into hundreds of independent microservices. Each team owned their service end-to-end, enabling independent deployment and scaling. They also moved entirely to AWS.</p><h3>Engineering Innovations</h3><p>Netflix developed tools like Hystrix (circuit breaker), Zuul (API gateway), and Eureka (service discovery) \u2014 many of which they open-sourced. Chaos Monkey proactively tested resilience by randomly terminating production instances.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>Microservices enable scale but add operational complexity. Strong DevOps culture and tooling are prerequisites. Incremental migration is safer than a big-bang rewrite.</p>",
