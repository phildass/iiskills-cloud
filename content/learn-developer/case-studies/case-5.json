  "content": "<h2>Case Study: Heartbleed</h2><p>In 2014, security researchers disclosed Heartbleed \u2014 a critical vulnerability in OpenSSL that allowed attackers to read up to 64KB of server memory per request, potentially exposing private keys, passwords, and session tokens.</p><h3>The Bug</h3><p>The Heartbeat extension in TLS/DTLS failed to validate the length of a request. An attacker could request a response much larger than the sent payload, causing the server to return adjacent memory contents.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>An estimated 17% of the internet's secure servers were vulnerable. Major companies including Yahoo, LastPass, and many cloud providers were affected. Mass certificate revocation and reissuance followed.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>Input validation is non-negotiable. Security audits of critical dependencies are essential. Developers must treat third-party libraries as potential attack surfaces.</p>",
