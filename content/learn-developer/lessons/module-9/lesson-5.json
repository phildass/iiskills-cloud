  "content": "<h2>Module 9, Lesson 5: Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</h2>\n\n<h3>The Hook</h3>\n<p>SSR generates HTML on each request (good for dynamic data); SSG generates HTML at build time (good for static content). Next.js supports both, plus ISR for incremental static regeneration.</p>\n<p>In this lesson, we explore how <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> fits within the broader context of <strong>Performance Optimisation</strong>. Building a solid understanding of these concepts will make you a more effective and confident full-stack developer.</p>\n\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Core Principles</h4>\n<p>The core principles behind <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> are grounded in decades of software engineering practice. These principles — separation of concerns, single responsibility, and fail-fast design — provide a reliable foundation for production-quality code.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Implementation Patterns</h4>\n<p>Experienced developers recognise patterns for <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> that solve common problems efficiently. Understanding when to apply each pattern — and knowing the trade-offs — separates good developers from great ones.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Performance Implications</h4>\n<p>Every technical decision in <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> has performance implications. Understanding the performance characteristics of different approaches helps you make informed choices that scale well under real-world loads.</p>\n\n<h4>4. Security Considerations</h4>\n<p>Security must be considered from the first line of code, not bolted on at the end. The security considerations relevant to <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> are concrete and actionable: if you understand them, you can prevent the most common vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n<h4>5. Testing and Debugging</h4>\n<p>Effective testing of <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> components ensures reliability and enables confident refactoring. Debugging skills — knowing how to isolate, reproduce, and fix issues — are equally important and developed only through practice.</p>\n\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>You have completed <strong>Server-Side Rendering vs Static Generation</strong> within the <strong>Performance Optimisation</strong> module. The key takeaways are: the core principles; common implementation patterns and their trade-offs; performance characteristics; security considerations; and testing approaches. Apply these insights in your next project and notice the difference in code quality and confidence. Continue to the next lesson to deepen your expertise.</p>",
