CI/CD pipelines catch bugs before they reach users, containerisation makes deployments reproducible, and infrastructure-as-code ensures environments are consistent. Modern developers own their code in production.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>CI/CD Pipelines</h4>\n<p><strong>Continuous Integration (CI)</strong>: every code push triggers automated build and test runs. Merge only green builds. This prevents integration hell. <strong>Continuous Delivery (CD)</strong>: every merge to main is automatically deployed to a staging environment. <strong>Continuous Deployment</strong>: every green build is deployed directly to production with no human gate.</p>\n<h4>Docker and Containers</h4>\n<p>Containers package an application with its dependencies into a portable, isolated unit. <strong>Docker</strong> builds images from a Dockerfile and runs them as containers. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host OS kernel, making them lightweight. <strong>Docker Compose</strong> orchestrates multi-container development environments.</p>\n<h4>Environment Variables and Secrets</h4>\n<p>Never hardcode credentials in source code. Use environment variables for configuration that varies between environments (dev, staging, prod). Use a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for sensitive values. Rotate secrets regularly and audit access.</p>\n\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>DevOps is a culture as much as a toolset: small, frequent releases, automated testing, infrastructure as code, and shared ownership of production. These practices reduce deployment risk and accelerate iteration.</p>",
