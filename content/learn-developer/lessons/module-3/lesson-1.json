  "content": "<h2>Module 3, Lesson 1: React Component Architecture</h2>\n\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>React's component model is a paradigm shift: instead of manipulating the DOM directly, you declare what the UI should look like given a state, and React figures out the minimal set of DOM updates required. This declarative approach scales from a single button to a complex dashboard.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>Components and Props</h4>\n<p>A React component is a function that takes <strong>props</strong> (inputs) and returns JSX (a description of the UI). Props flow downward — parent to child — creating a clear data hierarchy. Keep components small and single-purpose: if a component does more than one thing, split it.</p>\n<h4>State and the useState Hook</h4>\n<p><strong>State</strong> is private data managed inside a component that, when changed, triggers a re-render. <code>useState</code> returns the current value and a setter function. Never mutate state directly — always use the setter to ensure React tracks the change.</p>\n<h4>useEffect and Side Effects</h4>\n<p><code>useEffect</code> runs after every render by default. With a dependency array it runs only when specified values change. An empty array <code>[]</code> runs it once on mount. Return a cleanup function to prevent memory leaks (e.g., clearing timers or unsubscribing from events).</p>\n\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>React components are pure, composable, and predictable. Props carry data down, events bubble up. State lives where it's needed. Side effects are declared, not scattered. Master this mental model and building complex UIs becomes a systematic exercise.</p>",
