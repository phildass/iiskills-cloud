Mastering this area will help you build reliable, scalable, and maintainable web applications.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Fundamentals</h4>\n<p>Understanding the foundational principles of Component Lifecycle ensures you can apply them correctly in a variety of real-world scenarios. Always prefer clarity over cleverness.</p>\n<h4>2. Practical Application</h4>\n<p>Theory must translate into working code. In React Component Architecture, every concept has direct practical implications for how you architect, test, and deploy applications.</p>\n<h4>3. Common Pitfalls</h4>\n<p>Awareness of common mistakes in Component Lifecycle helps you avoid costly bugs and security vulnerabilities. Review real-world examples and practise defensive coding techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Best Practices</h4>\n<p>Industry best practices evolve constantly. Keep up with community standards, read production post-mortems, and participate in code reviews to sharpen your skills in React Component Architecture.</p>\n\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>You have completed <strong>Component Lifecycle</strong> in Module 3. Continue to the next lesson to build further expertise in <strong>React Component Architecture</strong>.</p>",
