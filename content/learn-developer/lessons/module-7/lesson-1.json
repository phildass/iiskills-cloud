It involves trade-offs between consistency and availability, latency and throughput, development speed and maintainability. Senior engineers are distinguished not by how fast they code, but by how well they design systems that survive growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>Scalability Patterns</h4>\n<p><strong>Vertical scaling</strong> adds resources to a single machine (more RAM, faster CPU). <strong>Horizontal scaling</strong> adds more machines. Horizontal scaling requires stateless services, load balancers, and distributed data stores. <strong>Caching</strong> (Redis, CDN) reduces load on origin servers. <strong>Message queues</strong> (RabbitMQ, SQS) decouple services and absorb traffic spikes.</p>\n<h4>Microservices vs Monolith</h4>\n<p>A <strong>monolith</strong> packages all functionality in one deployable unit — simple to develop and debug initially. <strong>Microservices</strong> decompose the application into independently deployable services — each with its own database, language, and deployment cadence. Microservices introduce distributed systems complexity; adopt them only when the monolith's bottlenecks are clear.</p>\n<h4>CAP Theorem</h4>\n<p>In a distributed system you can guarantee only two of three: <strong>Consistency</strong>, <strong>Availability</strong>, <strong>Partition tolerance</strong>. Since network partitions are inevitable, you must choose between CP (consistent but may be unavailable) and AP (always available but may return stale data).</p>\n\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Good system design starts with requirements: read/write ratios, data volume, latency SLAs, consistency needs. Sketch the data flow. Identify bottlenecks. Apply patterns judiciously. Document trade-offs explicitly.</p>",
