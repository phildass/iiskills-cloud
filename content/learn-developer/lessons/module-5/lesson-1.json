  "content": "<h2>Module 5, Lesson 1: Database Design — SQL vs NoSQL</h2>\n\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Data persistence is the backbone of every application. Choosing the right database is a system-design decision that affects scalability, consistency, query flexibility, and developer productivity for years. Understanding the fundamental differences between relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases lets you make the right choice — or the right combination.</p>\n\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>Relational Databases (SQL)</h4>\n<p>SQL databases store data in tables with fixed schemas and enforce ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Relationships are modelled via foreign keys and joins. They excel at complex queries, reporting, and workloads where data integrity is paramount. Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite.</p>\n<h4>Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)</h4>\n<p>NoSQL databases sacrifice strict consistency for flexibility and horizontal scale. Types include document stores (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), column-family stores (Cassandra), and graph databases (Neo4j). They suit high-write workloads, unstructured data, and distributed systems.</p>\n<h4>Indexing and Query Optimisation</h4>\n<p>An index is a data structure that speeds up reads at the cost of write overhead and storage. Without an index, a query scans every row. With one, it can jump directly to matching rows. Choose index columns that appear in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY clauses.</p>\n\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Use SQL when you need complex queries, transactions, and strong consistency. Use NoSQL when you need massive scale, flexible schemas, or specialised data models. Many production systems use both.</p>",
