Numbers like √2, √3, π, and e cannot be expressed as fractions of integers — they are irrational. The real numbers ℝ = ℚ ∪ {irrationals} form a complete ordered field that corresponds exactly to points on the number line.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Proving Irrationality</h4>\n<p>The classic proof that √2 is irrational uses proof by contradiction. Assume √2 = p/q in lowest terms. Then 2q² = p², so p is even (p = 2m). Substituting gives 2q² = 4m², so q² = 2m², meaning q is also even — contradicting p/q being in lowest terms.</p>\n<h4>2. Properties of Real Numbers</h4>\n<p>The reals form a complete ordered field: between any two real numbers there exists another real number (density), and every non-empty set bounded above has a least upper bound (completeness). These properties are what make calculus work.</p>\n<h4>3. Number Line Representation</h4>\n<p>Every real number corresponds to a unique point on the number line, and every point corresponds to a unique real number. This one-to-one correspondence is essential for geometry and analysis.</p>\n<h4>4. Special Constants</h4>\n<p>π ≈ 3.14159 (ratio of circle circumference to diameter) and e ≈ 2.71828 (base of natural logarithm) are transcendental — not only irrational but also not roots of any polynomial with rational coefficients.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>You explored irrational and real numbers, learned to prove irrationality by contradiction, and understood the completeness property that distinguishes ℝ from ℚ.</p>",
