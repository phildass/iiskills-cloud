Logarithms are the inverse: logb(x) asks \"to what power must we raise b to get x?\" These two operations are ubiquitous in science, engineering, finance, and computer science.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Laws of Exponents</h4>\n<p>bᵐ × bⁿ = bᵐ⁺ⁿ; (bᵐ)ⁿ = bᵐⁿ; bᵐ/bⁿ = bᵐ⁻ⁿ; b⁰ = 1; b⁻ⁿ = 1/bⁿ; b^(1/n) = ⁿ√b. These identities simplify complex computations.</p>\n<h4>2. Logarithm Definition and Laws</h4>\n<p>logb(x) = y ⟺ bʸ = x. Laws: logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y); logb(x/y) = logb(x) – logb(y); logb(xⁿ) = n·logb(x). Change of base: loga(x) = logb(x)/logb(a).</p>\n<h4>3. Natural Logarithm and e</h4>\n<p>The natural logarithm ln(x) = loge(x) where e ≈ 2.718 is Euler's number. ln is the integral of 1/t from 1 to x, and it appears naturally in calculus, probability, and growth models.</p>\n<h4>4. Applications</h4>\n<p>Compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Continuous growth: A = Peʳᵗ. The Richter scale for earthquakes and the decibel scale for sound are both logarithmic. Big-O notation in algorithms often involves log₂.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>Exponents and logarithms are inverse operations. You mastered the laws of exponents and logarithms, the natural logarithm, and key applications in finance, science, and computing.</p>",
