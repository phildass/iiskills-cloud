The rationals (ℚ) fill the gaps between integers on the number line, allowing us to represent measurements like 3/4 of a metre or –2/5 of a degree.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Equivalent Fractions</h4>\n<p>Two fractions a/b and c/d are equivalent if ad = bc. We simplify fractions by dividing numerator and denominator by their GCD. For example, 12/18 = 2/3 (dividing both by 6).</p>\n<h4>2. Arithmetic of Fractions</h4>\n<p>To add fractions: a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/(bd). To multiply: (a/b)(c/d) = ac/bd. Division by a fraction: (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b)(d/c) = ad/bc.</p>\n<h4>3. Decimal Representation</h4>\n<p>Every rational number has a decimal expansion that either terminates (e.g., 1/4 = 0.25) or eventually repeats (e.g., 1/3 = 0.333...). Conversely, every terminating or repeating decimal represents a rational number.</p>\n<h4>4. Ordering Rationals</h4>\n<p>To compare a/b and c/d (with b, d > 0), compare ad with bc. The number line gives a complete ordering: for any two distinct rationals, one is strictly greater than the other.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Rational numbers extend integers to include all fractions. You learned equivalent fractions, arithmetic operations, decimal expansions, and ordering. These skills are fundamental to algebra and measurement.</p>",
