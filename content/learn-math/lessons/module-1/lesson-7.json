  "content": "<h2>Module 1, Lesson 7: Introduction to Sequences and Series</h2>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, each called a term: a₁, a₂, a₃, ... A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence. Sequences appear in interest calculations, population models, and algorithm analysis. Understanding their patterns and sums is foundational to calculus and discrete mathematics.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Arithmetic Sequences</h4>\n<p>In an arithmetic sequence, each term differs from the previous by a constant difference d: aₙ = a₁ + (n–1)d. The sum of the first n terms: Sₙ = n(a₁ + aₙ)/2 = n(2a₁ + (n–1)d)/2.</p>\n<h4>2. Geometric Sequences</h4>\n<p>In a geometric sequence, each term is r times the previous: aₙ = a₁rⁿ⁻¹. The sum of n terms: Sₙ = a₁(1 – rⁿ)/(1 – r) for r ≠ 1. If |r| < 1, the infinite sum converges to a₁/(1 – r).</p>\n<h4>3. Fibonacci Sequence</h4>\n<p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by F₁ = 1, F₂ = 1, Fₙ = Fₙ₋₁ + Fₙ₋₂. Its terms (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...) appear in nature, art, and computer science algorithms.</p>\n<h4>4. Sigma Notation</h4>\n<p>The symbol Σ (sigma) denotes summation: Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ aᵢ = a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₙ. Common identities include Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ i = n(n+1)/2 and Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ i² = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>You covered arithmetic and geometric sequences and their sums, the Fibonacci sequence, and sigma notation. These tools are used throughout calculus, financial mathematics, and algorithm analysis.</p>",
