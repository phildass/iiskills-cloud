They model supply and demand equilibria, mixing problems, force balances, and circuit analysis. Mastery of the key solution methods — substitution, elimination, and matrix methods — is essential for applied mathematics and engineering.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Substitution Method</h4>\n<p>Solve one equation for one variable, substitute into the other equation. For example: y = 2x – 1 and 3x + y = 8 → 3x + (2x – 1) = 8 → 5x = 9 → x = 9/5, y = 13/5.</p>\n<h4>2. Elimination Method</h4>\n<p>Multiply equations to make coefficients of one variable equal, then add/subtract to eliminate it. Add equations if signs differ; subtract if signs are the same.</p>\n<h4>3. Graphical Interpretation</h4>\n<p>Each linear equation in two variables is a line. The solution to the system is the intersection point. No solution means parallel lines; infinitely many solutions means the lines coincide.</p>\n<h4>4. Non-Linear Systems</h4>\n<p>Systems can include quadratic or other non-linear equations. A circle and line may intersect at 0, 1, or 2 points. Substitution from the linear equation into the non-linear usually yields a solvable quadratic.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>Simultaneous equations are solved by substitution, elimination, or graphical methods. You also saw how non-linear systems arise and how to handle them. These techniques are indispensable in science, economics, and engineering.</p>",
