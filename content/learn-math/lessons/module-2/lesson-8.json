Surds like √2, √3, and ∛5 arise constantly in geometry, physics, and engineering. Manipulating them in exact form (rationalising, simplifying) is an important algebraic skill.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Laws of Indices</h4>\n<p>aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ; (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ; aᵐ/aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ; a⁰ = 1; a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ; a^(p/q) = (ᵠ√a)ᵖ. These are the tools for simplifying all exponential expressions.</p>\n<h4>2. Simplifying Surds</h4>\n<p>√(ab) = √a × √b; √(a/b) = √a/√b. Simplify by factoring out perfect squares: √48 = √(16 × 3) = 4√3. Like surds can be combined: 3√2 + 5√2 = 8√2.</p>\n<h4>3. Rationalising the Denominator</h4>\n<p>To eliminate surds from a denominator: for 1/√a, multiply by √a/√a. For 1/(a + √b), multiply by the conjugate (a – √b)/(a – √b), using the difference of squares identity (a + b)(a – b) = a² – b².</p>\n<h4>4. Fractional Indices</h4>\n<p>aᵖ/ᵠ = (ᵠ√a)ᵖ = ᵠ√(aᵖ). So 8^(2/3) = (∛8)² = 2² = 4. Fractional indices unify the treatment of roots and powers.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>You practised all laws of indices, simplified surds, rationalised denominators, and used fractional indices. These skills are prerequisites for calculus and allow exact rather than approximate calculation.</p>",
