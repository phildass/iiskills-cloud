Its solutions are the x-values where a parabola crosses the x-axis. Quadratics model projectile motion, areas, profit maximisation, and physics. They are solved by factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Factoring Quadratics</h4>\n<p>If ax² + bx + c = (px + q)(rx + s), then setting each factor to zero gives solutions. For x² – 5x + 6 = 0: (x – 2)(x – 3) = 0, so x = 2 or x = 3.</p>\n<h4>2. Quadratic Formula</h4>\n<p>x = (–b ± √(b² – 4ac)) / (2a). This always works. The discriminant Δ = b² – 4ac determines the nature of roots: Δ > 0 gives two real roots; Δ = 0 gives one repeated real root; Δ < 0 gives two complex conjugate roots.</p>\n<h4>3. Completing the Square</h4>\n<p>x² + bx = (x + b/2)² – (b/2)². This method derives the quadratic formula and is used to convert quadratics to vertex form y = a(x – h)² + k, revealing the vertex (h, k) of the parabola.</p>\n<h4>4. Vieta's Formulas</h4>\n<p>For roots r₁, r₂ of ax² + bx + c = 0: r₁ + r₂ = –b/a and r₁ × r₂ = c/a. These relate coefficients to roots without solving the equation.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>You solved quadratic equations by factoring, the quadratic formula, and completing the square. The discriminant determines root type. Vieta's formulas connect roots to coefficients. Quadratics are ubiquitous in science and engineering.</p>",
