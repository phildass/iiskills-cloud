Variation describes how one variable changes with another. These concepts arise constantly in scaling, recipe calculation, map reading, physics (Hooke's law, Ohm's law), and engineering design.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Ratios and Simplification</h4>\n<p>A ratio a:b is equivalent to a/b. Simplify by dividing both terms by their GCD. Share 120 in the ratio 3:2:1: total parts = 6; shares are 60, 40, 20.</p>\n<h4>2. Direct Proportion</h4>\n<p>y is directly proportional to x (y ∝ x) if y = kx for some constant k. The graph is a straight line through the origin. Double x, double y. k is the constant of proportionality.</p>\n<h4>3. Inverse Proportion</h4>\n<p>y is inversely proportional to x (y ∝ 1/x) if y = k/x. Double x, halve y. This models speed–time relationships (at constant distance) and Boyle's law (PV = constant at fixed temperature).</p>\n<h4>4. Joint and Combined Variation</h4>\n<p>y ∝ xz means y = kxz (joint). y ∝ x/z means y = kx/z (combined). These appear in physics (F = ma), fluid mechanics, and gravity (F ∝ m₁m₂/r²).</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Ratios and proportions scale quantities; variation equations model physical relationships. You practised simplifying ratios, sharing in ratios, and setting up direct, inverse, and joint variation equations.</p>",
