While arithmetic asks \"what is 3 + 4?\", algebra asks \"if x + 4 = 7, what is x?\" This shift from specific numbers to general relationships is the key power of algebra. It underlies every field of science, engineering, finance, and computer science.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Variables and Expressions</h4>\n<p>A variable (typically x, y, z) is a symbol representing an unknown or varying quantity. An algebraic expression combines variables and constants using arithmetic operations: 3x² – 2y + 7 is an expression with two variables and three terms.</p>\n<h4>2. Equations vs Expressions</h4>\n<p>An expression has no equals sign and cannot be \"solved\" — only simplified or evaluated. An equation (e.g., 2x + 3 = 11) has an equals sign and can be solved to find the value(s) of x that make it true.</p>\n<h4>3. Simplifying Expressions</h4>\n<p>Combine like terms (same variable and exponent): 3x + 5x = 8x. Distribute: a(b + c) = ab + ac. Factorising reverses distribution: 6x² + 9x = 3x(2x + 3).</p>\n<h4>4. Solving Linear Equations</h4>\n<p>A linear equation has degree 1 (highest power of variable is 1). To solve: isolate the variable by performing the same operations on both sides. For 2x + 3 = 11: subtract 3 (get 2x = 8), then divide by 2 (get x = 4).</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Algebra generalises arithmetic using variables. You learned to distinguish expressions from equations, simplify by combining like terms and distributing, and solve basic linear equations. These skills are the foundation for all higher mathematics.</p>",
