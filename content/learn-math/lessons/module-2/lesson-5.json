Functions are the central objects of analysis. Their graphs — curves in the xy-plane — visualise relationships between quantities and reveal properties like intercepts, symmetry, maxima, and minima.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Definition of a Function</h4>\n<p>The vertical line test: a curve represents a function iff every vertical line intersects it at most once. The domain is the set of valid inputs; the range is the set of actual outputs.</p>\n<h4>2. Types of Functions</h4>\n<p>Linear (degree 1), quadratic (degree 2), polynomial (degree n), rational (ratio of polynomials), exponential (bˣ), logarithmic (log x), trigonometric (sin, cos), and piecewise functions are the main types.</p>\n<h4>3. Function Transformations</h4>\n<p>Starting from y = f(x): vertical shift y = f(x) + c (up c); horizontal shift y = f(x – c) (right c); reflection y = –f(x) (about x-axis); vertical stretch y = cf(x). Combining these transforms any base function.</p>\n<h4>4. Composition and Inverse</h4>\n<p>Composition (f ∘ g)(x) = f(g(x)) — apply g first, then f. The inverse function f⁻¹ satisfies f(f⁻¹(x)) = x. Its graph is the reflection of f across y = x. f⁻¹ exists iff f is one-to-one (bijective).</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Functions formalise input-output relationships. You learned the vertical line test, types of functions, transformations, and composition/inverse operations. Functions are the main language of calculus and mathematical analysis.</p>",
