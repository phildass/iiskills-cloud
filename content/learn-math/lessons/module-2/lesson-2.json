  "content": "<h2>Module 2, Lesson 2: Linear Equations and Inequalities</h2>\n<h3>The Hook</h3>\n<p>Linear equations model constant-rate relationships. A linear equation in one variable has the form ax + b = c; in two variables, ax + by = c, which graphs as a straight line. Inequalities (ax + b > c, ≤, ≥) define regions on the number line or plane. These tools model budgets, speed, time, and almost any real-world constraint.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Solving One-Variable Linear Equations</h4>\n<p>Use inverse operations to isolate the variable. Keep the equation balanced by doing the same thing to both sides. Multi-step: 3(x – 2) = 9 → 3x – 6 = 9 → 3x = 15 → x = 5.</p>\n<h4>2. Linear Equations in Two Variables</h4>\n<p>y = mx + b is slope-intercept form: m is the slope (rise/run), b is the y-intercept. The slope between (x₁,y₁) and (x₂,y₂) is m = (y₂–y₁)/(x₂–x₁).</p>\n<h4>3. Linear Inequalities</h4>\n<p>Solve like an equation, but reverse the inequality sign when multiplying/dividing by a negative: –2x > 6 → x < –3. Graph on a number line: open circle for strict inequalities, closed circle for ≤ and ≥.</p>\n<h4>4. Systems of Linear Equations</h4>\n<p>Two equations, two unknowns. Methods: substitution (express one variable in terms of the other), elimination (add/subtract equations to eliminate a variable), or graphing (find the intersection point).</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>You practised solving linear equations and inequalities, graphing lines using slope-intercept form, and solving systems of equations by substitution and elimination. These techniques model a vast range of real-world problems.</p>",
