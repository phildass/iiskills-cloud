  "content": "<h2>Module 2, Lesson 4: Polynomials</h2>\n<h3>The Hook</h3>\n<p>A polynomial is an expression of the form aₙxⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₁x + a₀, where the exponents are non-negative integers and the coefficients aᵢ are real numbers. The degree is the highest exponent. Polynomials are the simplest functions in mathematics and form the starting point for analysis, algebra, and numerical methods.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Polynomial Arithmetic</h4>\n<p>Add/subtract polynomials by combining like terms. Multiply using the distributive law (and FOIL for binomials): (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. Divide polynomials using long division or synthetic division.</p>\n<h4>2. The Remainder Theorem</h4>\n<p>If polynomial P(x) is divided by (x – k), the remainder is P(k). So to find P(3) for P(x) = x³ – 2x + 1: compute 3³ – 2(3) + 1 = 27 – 6 + 1 = 22.</p>\n<h4>3. The Factor Theorem</h4>\n<p>(x – k) is a factor of P(x) if and only if P(k) = 0. So finding roots of P(x) = 0 is equivalent to finding its linear factors.</p>\n<h4>4. Polynomial Graphs</h4>\n<p>A polynomial of degree n has at most n real roots and at most n–1 turning points. Even-degree polynomials with positive leading coefficient open upward; odd-degree polynomials have opposite end behaviours.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>Polynomials are the workhorse functions of algebra. You learned polynomial arithmetic, the Remainder and Factor Theorems, and how the degree governs the graph's shape. These skills are prerequisites for calculus and numerical methods.</p>",
