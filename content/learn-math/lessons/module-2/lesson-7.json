They define ranges of values rather than single solutions and are essential for modelling constraints in optimisation, engineering tolerances, and probability bounds. Absolute value inequalities extend this to two-sided constraints on distance from a point.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Properties of Inequalities</h4>\n<p>Adding/subtracting the same quantity preserves the inequality. Multiplying/dividing by a positive number preserves it; by a negative number reverses it. Transitivity: a < b and b < c implies a < c.</p>\n<h4>2. Compound Inequalities</h4>\n<p>Conjunction (AND): a < x < b — x lies between a and b. Disjunction (OR): x < a or x > b. Represent on number line and write as interval notation: [a, b], (a, b), (–∞, a) ∪ (b, ∞).</p>\n<h4>3. Absolute Value Equations</h4>\n<p>|x| = k (k ≥ 0) gives x = k or x = –k. |2x – 3| = 7 → 2x – 3 = 7 (x = 5) or 2x – 3 = –7 (x = –2).</p>\n<h4>4. Absolute Value Inequalities</h4>\n<p>|x| < k ↔ –k < x < k (intersection). |x| > k ↔ x < –k or x > k (union). These represent proximity to or distance from a point on the number line.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>Inequalities model ranges and constraints. You solved compound inequalities, absolute value equations and inequalities, and used interval notation. These concepts are central to analysis, optimisation, and real-world constraint modelling.</p>",
