Mastering these concepts will give you a solid foundation for subsequent lessons and real-world applications.</p>\n\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Core Definitions</h4>\n<p>We begin with precise definitions that form the bedrock of <strong>The Sine Rule</strong>. A rigorous understanding of terminology prevents ambiguity and enables exact communication and proof.</p>\n\n<h4>2. Fundamental Theorems and Results</h4>\n<p>The central theorems of <strong>The Sine Rule</strong> provide powerful tools for solving problems. We state each result clearly, explain the intuition behind it, and work through representative examples.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Worked Examples</h4>\n<p>Each concept is illustrated with step-by-step worked examples. Pay close attention to the reasoning at each step — it is as important as the final answer.</p>\n\n<h4>4. Common Misconceptions</h4>\n<p>Students often confuse closely related ideas in <strong>The Sine Rule</strong>. We highlight these distinctions explicitly so you can avoid common errors in exams and practical work.</p>\n\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>You have completed the study of <strong>The Sine Rule</strong> in Module 4 (Trigonometry). The key ideas covered in this lesson will be built upon in subsequent lessons. Attempt the quiz to consolidate your understanding before moving on.</p>",
