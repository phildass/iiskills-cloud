  "content": "<h2>Case Study: GPS Navigation</h2><p>Your smartphone's GPS receiver calculates your position by measuring the time delay of signals from at least four satellites. Each satellite defines a sphere of possible positions; the intersection of three spheres gives a unique location in 3D space — a direct application of coordinate geometry and the distance formula.</p><h3>Key Mathematical Concepts</h3><ul><li><strong>Distance Formula</strong>: d = √((x₂–x₁)² + (y₂–y₁)² + (z₂–z₁)²) in 3D.</li><li><strong>Trilateration</strong>: Solving simultaneous equations of spheres to find the unique intersection point.</li><li><strong>Map Projections</strong>: Converting spherical Earth coordinates (latitude/longitude) to a flat 2D map using geometric transformations.</li></ul><h3>Real-World Impact</h3><p>From Ola and Uber rides to India's Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (NavIC), coordinate geometry underpins modern navigation. Understanding the mathematics demystifies how a device in your pocket knows exactly where you are on Earth.</p>",
