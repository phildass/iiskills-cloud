  "content": "<h2>Case Study: LLMs in Indian Banking</h2><p>HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and SBI are among India's leading financial institutions exploring AI-powered customer service. With millions of customers and limited branch capacity, these banks need to handle high query volumes efficiently.</p><h3>The AI Solution</h3><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures power conversational AI systems that can answer customer queries in English, Hindi, and regional languages. The models are fine-tuned on banking-specific data.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>HDFC's AI system handles millions of customer interactions monthly, reducing call centre volume and improving first-response resolution rates. Fraud detection models analyse transaction patterns in real-time to flag anomalies.</p><h3>Key Learning</h3><p>LLMs require significant fine-tuning and safety guardrails for financial applications. Data privacy (RBI guidelines) adds regulatory constraints that shape model design.</p>",
