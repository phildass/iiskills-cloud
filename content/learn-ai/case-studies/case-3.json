  "content": "<h2>Case Study: AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection</h2><p>India has over 120 million smallholder farmers, many without access to agricultural extension services. Crop disease can wipe out a season's income — and delayed diagnosis worsens outcomes.</p><h3>The AI System</h3><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on hundreds of thousands of plant leaf images can identify diseases with accuracy matching or exceeding agronomists. Apps like Plantix and ICAR-backed platforms let farmers photograph affected leaves and receive instant diagnoses with treatment recommendations.</p><h3>Impact</h3><p>Early pilots in Maharashtra and Punjab showed 30-40% reduction in unnecessary pesticide use when farmers received accurate AI diagnoses. NITI Aayog has highlighted AI agriculture as a priority for India's 2047 vision.</p><h3>Key Learning</h3><p>Transfer learning allows CNNs trained on ImageNet to be fine-tuned on agricultural datasets with limited labelled data — making this technology accessible to resource-constrained organisations.</p>",
