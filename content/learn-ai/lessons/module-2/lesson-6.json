India's radiologist shortage makes medical imaging AI one of the highest-impact CV applications.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Core CV tasks (classification, detection, segmentation)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Core CV tasks (classification, detection, segmentation) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</h4>\n<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Medical imaging AI in India (Qure.ai, Niramai)</h4>\n<p>Medical imaging AI in India (Qure.ai, Niramai) is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Agriculture and satellite image analysis</h4>\n<p>Mastering Agriculture and satellite image analysis separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Core CV tasks (classification, detection, segmentation), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Medical imaging AI in India (Qure.ai, Niramai), and Agriculture and satellite image analysis. These are the building blocks of computer vision — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
