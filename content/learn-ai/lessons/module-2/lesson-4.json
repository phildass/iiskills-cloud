AI: the broadest category</h4>\n<p>Understanding AI: the broadest category is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Machine Learning: data-driven subset of AI</h4>\n<p>Machine Learning: data-driven subset of AI forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Deep Learning: neural-network subset of ML</h4>\n<p>Deep Learning: neural-network subset of ML is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. When to use traditional ML vs deep learning</h4>\n<p>Mastering When to use traditional ML vs deep learning separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered AI: the broadest category, Machine Learning: data-driven subset of AI, Deep Learning: neural-network subset of ML, and When to use traditional ML vs deep learning. These are the building blocks of machine learning vs deep learning vs ai — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
