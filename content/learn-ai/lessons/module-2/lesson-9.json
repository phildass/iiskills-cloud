India is the second largest ChatGPT user base globally.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Large Language Models (GPT-4, Gemini, Llama)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Large Language Models (GPT-4, Gemini, Llama) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)</h4>\n<p>Diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Prompt engineering for Indian contexts</h4>\n<p>Prompt engineering for Indian contexts is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Risks: hallucinations, deepfakes, misinformation</h4>\n<p>Mastering Risks: hallucinations, deepfakes, misinformation separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Large Language Models (GPT-4, Gemini, Llama), Diffusion models (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E), Prompt engineering for Indian contexts, and Risks: hallucinations, deepfakes, misinformation. These are the building blocks of generative ai \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
