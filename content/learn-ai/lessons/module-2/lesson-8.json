Although superseded by ML, knowledge-based AI survives in knowledge graphs and hybrid systems.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Architecture: knowledge base, inference engine, user interface</h4>\n<p>Understanding Architecture: knowledge base, inference engine, user interface is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Forward vs backward chaining</h4>\n<p>Forward vs backward chaining forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Knowledge graphs: Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata</h4>\n<p>Knowledge graphs: Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Limitations and modern alternatives</h4>\n<p>Mastering Limitations and modern alternatives separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Architecture: knowledge base, inference engine, user interface, Forward vs backward chaining, Knowledge graphs: Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata, and Limitations and modern alternatives. These are the building blocks of expert systems and knowledge-based ai \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
