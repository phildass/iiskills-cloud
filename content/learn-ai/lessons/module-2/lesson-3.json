Neither exists yet but understanding them highlights what genuine intelligence requires.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Theory of Mind: understanding others' mental states</h4>\n<p>Understanding Theory of Mind: understanding others' mental states is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Self-aware AI (still science fiction)</h4>\n<p>Self-aware AI (still science fiction) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Emotional intelligence in AI</h4>\n<p>Emotional intelligence in AI is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. The Turing Test and its limitations</h4>\n<p>Mastering The Turing Test and its limitations separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Theory of Mind: understanding others' mental states, Self-aware AI (still science fiction), Emotional intelligence in AI, and The Turing Test and its limitations. These are the building blocks of theory of mind and self-aware ai \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
