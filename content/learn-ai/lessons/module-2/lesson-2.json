Understanding these categories clarifies what today's AI can and cannot do.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Reactive machines (stateless AI)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Reactive machines (stateless AI) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Limited memory AI</h4>\n<p>Limited memory AI forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. How ML models use training-time memory</h4>\n<p>How ML models use training-time memory is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Real-time limited memory in Indian apps</h4>\n<p>Mastering Real-time limited memory in Indian apps separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Reactive machines (stateless AI), Limited memory AI, How ML models use training-time memory, and Real-time limited memory in Indian apps. These are the building blocks of reactive machines and limited memory ai \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
