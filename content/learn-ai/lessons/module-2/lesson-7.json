  "content": "<h2>Module 2, Lesson 7: Robotics and Autonomous Systems</h2>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>Robotics combines AI with physical interaction. India's manufacturing sector, space programme, and logistics industry are deploying AI-powered robots at scale.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. AI in industrial robotics (cobots)</h4>\n<p>Understanding AI in industrial robotics (cobots) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Autonomous vehicles in India</h4>\n<p>Autonomous vehicles in India forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Drone delivery and warehouse robots</h4>\n<p>Drone delivery and warehouse robots is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Reinforcement learning for robotic control</h4>\n<p>Mastering Reinforcement learning for robotic control separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered AI in industrial robotics (cobots), Autonomous vehicles in India, Drone delivery and warehouse robots, and Reinforcement learning for robotic control. These are the building blocks of robotics and autonomous systems \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
