Matplotlib and Seaborn are the standard Python libraries for creating publication-quality charts. In India, Data scientists at Zomato and Flipkart use Matplotlib/Seaborn for daily analytics dashboards and A/B test reporting.</p>\n<p>This lesson covers the essential concepts, practical tools, and India-specific applications you need to master matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Matplotlib Figure and Axes Architecture</h4>\n<p>Understanding matplotlib figure and axes architecture is foundational to matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation. Practitioners apply these principles daily in building robust AI systems for India's growing tech ecosystem.</p>\n<h4>2. Seaborn Statistical Plots</h4>\n<p>Seaborn Statistical Plots provides the theoretical and practical framework for implementing effective solutions. India's technology sector widely adopts these approaches in production systems.</p>\n<h4>3. Customising Charts (Titles, Labels, Colours)</h4>\n<p>The application of customising charts (titles, labels, colours) is critical for production-grade AI systems. Leading Indian companies rely on these techniques to build scalable, reliable AI products.</p>\n<h4>4. Saving and Exporting Visualisations</h4>\n<p>Saving and Exporting Visualisations represents advanced practice in matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation. Mastering this concept is what distinguishes expert AI practitioners building cutting-edge systems.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>In this lesson you covered Matplotlib Figure and Axes Architecture, Seaborn Statistical Plots, Customising Charts (Titles, Labels, Colours), and Saving and Exporting Visualisations — all essential aspects of matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation. Apply these concepts in your projects using India-specific datasets to build real-world experience and a strong portfolio.</p>",
