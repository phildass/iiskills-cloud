In India, Data analysts at Zepto, Blinkit, and HDFC Bank use Pandas daily for transaction data analysis and reporting.</p>\n<p>This lesson covers the essential concepts, practical tools, and India-specific applications you need to master pandas for data manipulation.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. DataFrame and Series: Pandas Core Structures</h4>\n<p>Understanding dataframe and series: pandas core structures is foundational to pandas for data manipulation. Practitioners apply these principles daily in building robust AI systems for India's growing tech ecosystem.</p>\n<h4>2. Filtering, Grouping, and Aggregation</h4>\n<p>Filtering, Grouping, and Aggregation provides the theoretical and practical framework for implementing effective solutions. India's technology sector widely adopts these approaches in production systems.</p>\n<h4>3. Merging and Joining DataFrames</h4>\n<p>The application of merging and joining dataframes is critical for production-grade AI systems. Leading Indian companies rely on these techniques to build scalable, reliable AI products.</p>\n<h4>4. Time Series Handling</h4>\n<p>Time Series Handling represents advanced practice in pandas for data manipulation. Mastering this concept is what distinguishes expert AI practitioners building cutting-edge systems.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>In this lesson you covered DataFrame and Series: Pandas Core Structures, Filtering, Grouping, and Aggregation, Merging and Joining DataFrames, and Time Series Handling — all essential aspects of pandas for data manipulation. Apply these concepts in your projects using India-specific datasets to build real-world experience and a strong portfolio.</p>",
