In India, Google India, Ola, and Swiggy use TensorFlow for computer vision, NLP, and demand forecasting models in production.</p>\n<p>This lesson covers the essential concepts, practical tools, and India-specific applications you need to master tensorflow fundamentals.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Tensors: The Basic Data Unit</h4>\n<p>Understanding tensors: the basic data unit is foundational to tensorflow fundamentals. Practitioners apply these principles daily in building robust AI systems for India's growing tech ecosystem.</p>\n<h4>2. Keras: TensorFlow's High-Level API</h4>\n<p>Keras: TensorFlow's High-Level API provides the theoretical and practical framework for implementing effective solutions. India's technology sector widely adopts these approaches in production systems.</p>\n<h4>3. Building a Sequential Model</h4>\n<p>The application of building a sequential model is critical for production-grade AI systems. Leading Indian companies rely on these techniques to build scalable, reliable AI products.</p>\n<h4>4. Saving and Loading TensorFlow Models</h4>\n<p>Saving and Loading TensorFlow Models represents advanced practice in tensorflow fundamentals. Mastering this concept is what distinguishes expert AI practitioners building cutting-edge systems.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>In this lesson you covered Tensors: The Basic Data Unit, Keras: TensorFlow's High-Level API, Building a Sequential Model, and Saving and Loading TensorFlow Models — all essential aspects of tensorflow fundamentals. Apply these concepts in your projects using India-specific datasets to build real-world experience and a strong portfolio.</p>",
