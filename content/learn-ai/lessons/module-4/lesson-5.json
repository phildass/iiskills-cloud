In India, Scikit-learn powers fraud detection models at Indian banks, churn models at telcos, and price prediction tools at PropTiger.</p>\n<p>This lesson covers the essential concepts, practical tools, and India-specific applications you need to master scikit-learn basics.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. The Scikit-learn API: fit(), predict(), transform()</h4>\n<p>Understanding the scikit-learn api: fit(), predict(), transform() is foundational to scikit-learn basics. Practitioners apply these principles daily in building robust AI systems for India's growing tech ecosystem.</p>\n<h4>2. Model Selection: Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation</h4>\n<p>Model Selection: Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation provides the theoretical and practical framework for implementing effective solutions. India's technology sector widely adopts these approaches in production systems.</p>\n<h4>3. Pipeline: Chaining Preprocessing and Modelling</h4>\n<p>The application of pipeline: chaining preprocessing and modelling is critical for production-grade AI systems. Leading Indian companies rely on these techniques to build scalable, reliable AI products.</p>\n<h4>4. Metrics: Evaluating Model Performance</h4>\n<p>Metrics: Evaluating Model Performance represents advanced practice in scikit-learn basics. Mastering this concept is what distinguishes expert AI practitioners building cutting-edge systems.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>In this lesson you covered The Scikit-learn API: fit(), predict(), transform(), Model Selection: Train-Test Split and Cross-Validation, Pipeline: Chaining Preprocessing and Modelling, and Metrics: Evaluating Model Performance — all essential aspects of scikit-learn basics. Apply these concepts in your projects using India-specific datasets to build real-world experience and a strong portfolio.</p>",
