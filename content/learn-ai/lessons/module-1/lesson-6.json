  "content": "<h2>Module 1, Lesson 6: The AI Development Pipeline</h2>\n<h3>The Hook</h3>\n<p>Building an AI solution is not a single step — it is a structured pipeline with distinct phases: data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Skipping or rushing any phase leads to models that fail in production. Understanding the pipeline helps you plan projects, estimate timelines, and identify where things went wrong.</p>\n<p>India's AI practitioners work across all pipeline stages. Data engineers at TCS build data ingestion pipelines; ML engineers at Zepto train demand forecasting models; MLOps engineers at Razorpay monitor fraud detection models in production. Each role maps to a phase in the AI development pipeline.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Phase 1: Problem Definition and Data Strategy</h4>\n<p>Before touching any code, define the problem clearly: What decision will the AI assist? What data exists? What metric defines success? A poorly defined problem is the #1 cause of AI project failure. In India, data often exists in fragmented form across government departments or enterprise silos — data strategy must address this.</p>\n<h4>2. Phase 2: Data Collection, Cleaning, and Labelling</h4>\n<p>Data is the raw material of AI. Collection sources include databases, APIs, web scraping, sensors, and crowdsourcing. Cleaning addresses missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Labelling (annotating data with ground truth) is often the most expensive phase — Indian data annotation companies like iMerit and Appen India are global leaders.</p>\n<h4>3. Phase 3: Feature Engineering and Model Training</h4>\n<p>Feature engineering transforms raw data into informative inputs for the model. Model training optimises model parameters to minimise a loss function. This phase requires computational resources (GPUs) and experiment tracking. Tools: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, MLflow for experiment management.</p>\n<h4>4. Phase 4: Model Evaluation and Validation</h4>\n<p>After training, evaluate performance on a held-out test set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, F1, RMSE, AUC-ROC). Bias and fairness testing is critical — models must perform equitably across demographic groups. For India-specific models, test on regional dialects, script variants, and rural data distributions.</p>\n<h4>5. Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring</h4>\n<p>Deployment packages the model as an API or embedded system. Monitoring tracks real-world performance, detecting data drift (when the world changes and model accuracy degrades). Continuous retraining pipelines keep models fresh. Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI, Azure ML.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>The AI development pipeline — problem definition, data collection, feature engineering, training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring — is a structured workflow that transforms a business need into a working AI system. Each phase has its own tools, challenges, and best practices. Mastering the full pipeline, not just model training, is what separates AI practitioners from beginners.</p>",
