  "content": "<h2>Module 1, Lesson 4: AI in India — ISRO, Aadhaar, DigiYatra, UPI</h2>\n<h3>The Hook</h3>\n<p>India has built some of the world's most ambitious digital infrastructure at unprecedented scale. The \"India Stack\" — a set of open APIs and digital public goods — is the backbone of AI-powered services reaching over a billion people. No other country has deployed digital systems at India's scale, speed, and cost-efficiency.</p>\n<p>Understanding how India's large-scale AI deployments work is essential for any AI practitioner who wants to build for Bharat. These systems are not just technically impressive — they represent a model for how developing nations can leapfrog traditional technology phases using AI.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. ISRO: AI in Space Technology</h4>\n<p>The Indian Space Research Organisation uses AI in satellite image analysis (identifying agricultural patterns, urban growth, flood mapping), autonomous fault detection in spacecraft systems, and trajectory optimisation. Chandrayaan-3's soft landing used AI-based navigation algorithms. ISRO processes terabytes of remote sensing data daily using ML pipelines.</p>\n<h4>2. Aadhaar: Biometric AI at Billion Scale</h4>\n<p>Aadhaar's biometric authentication system is the world's largest biometric database — over 1.3 billion people. AI powers fingerprint and iris matching at sub-second speed with 99.9% accuracy. The system handles over 60 million authentications per day, enabling banking (Jan Dhan), subsidies (DBT), and SIM verification.</p>\n<h4>3. DigiYatra: AI at Indian Airports</h4>\n<p>DigiYatra enables paperless airport entry using facial recognition AI. Passengers register once; thereafter, face recognition replaces boarding passes. The system is deployed at 24+ Indian airports. The AI model maps facial geometry and matches against the DGCA database in under 3 seconds.</p>\n<h4>4. UPI: AI-Powered Payments Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>India's Unified Payments Interface processed over 10 billion transactions per month in 2024. AI enables real-time fraud detection at NPCI, intelligent dispute resolution, and merchant analytics. The RBI's AI-based regulatory sandbox allows fintech companies to test AI-powered financial products safely.</p>\n<h4>5. NITI Aayog and India AI Mission</h4>\n<p>NITI Aayog's National Strategy for AI identified healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities, and mobility as priority sectors. The India AI Mission (2024, ₹10,372 crore) funds GPU compute infrastructure, AI startups, and research centres. IndiaAI.gov.in is the central hub for AI governance and datasets.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>India's AI story is unique: billion-scale deployment, government-led digital infrastructure, and a thriving private sector. ISRO, Aadhaar, DigiYatra, and UPI demonstrate that India is not just an AI consumer but a global innovator. As an AI practitioner in India, you are building on the strongest digital foundation in the developing world.</p>",
