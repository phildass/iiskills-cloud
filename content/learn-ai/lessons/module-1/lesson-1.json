These processes include learning (acquiring information and the rules to use it), reasoning (applying rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction. AI has moved from science fiction to a technology that shapes every aspect of modern life.</p>\n      <p>We are living through what historians will likely call the AI Revolution — a transformation as profound as the Industrial Revolution or the invention of the internet. Understanding AI is no longer optional for knowledge workers; it is a career imperative.</p>\n      <p>This lesson introduces the three foundational pillars of AI: machine learning, neural networks, and practical model deployment.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Concept</h3>\n      <h4>1. The Three Paradigms of AI Learning</h4>\n      <p><strong>Supervised Learning</strong> trains on labelled data to map inputs to outputs. <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong> discovers hidden patterns without labelled data. <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> trains an agent through trial and error, receiving rewards for desired actions.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Neural Networks and Deep Learning</h4>\n      <p>A neural network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, each computing a weighted sum of inputs passed through an activation function. CNNs excel at image tasks; RNNs handle sequential data; Transformer architectures power large language models like GPT.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</h4>\n      <p>Raw data requires cleaning: handling missing values, normalising numerical features, encoding categorical variables, and removing outliers. Feature engineering — creating informative inputs for the model — often determines the ceiling of model performance.</p>\n\n      <h4>4. Model Evaluation and Validation</h4>\n      <p>The train/test split separates data for training and unbiased evaluation. Cross-validation provides more robust estimates. Key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification; RMSE, MAE for regression. Overfitting (low training error, high test error) is addressed via regularisation, dropout, and ensemble methods.</p>\n\n      <h4>5. Responsible AI and Ethics</h4>\n      <p>AI systems inherit and amplify biases present in training data. Fairness, accountability, and transparency are engineering requirements, not just ethical aspirations. GDPR, AI Act, and emerging governance frameworks impose legal obligations on AI practitioners.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Illustration</h3>\n      <p>AI is the discipline of creating systems that learn, reason, and act. In this lesson you have covered: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning; neural networks and deep learning architectures; data preprocessing; model evaluation; and AI ethics. These foundations underpin every topic in this course.</p>",
