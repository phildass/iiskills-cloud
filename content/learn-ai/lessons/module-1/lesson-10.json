This lesson guides you through setting up your development environment and taking your first steps with real AI projects. Many successful Indian AI practitioners started with small, focused projects on Indian datasets — a crop disease classifier, a Hindi sentiment analyser, or a UPI transaction categoriser.</p>\n<p>You do not need expensive hardware or a PhD to get started. Free tools like Google Colab, Kaggle, and Hugging Face remove barriers. India's open datasets provide interesting problems to work on. The key is to start building, fail fast, and iterate.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Setting Up Your AI Environment</h4>\n<p>Install Python 3.10+ (Anaconda distribution recommended). Essential libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch. Use Google Colab for GPU access without hardware investment. VS Code with the Python extension is the most popular editor. Version control with Git is mandatory for any serious project.</p>\n<h4>2. Kaggle: Competitions and Learning</h4>\n<p>Kaggle hosts machine learning competitions with real datasets and prize money. Indian teams regularly rank in the global top 10. Start with beginner competitions (Titanic survival, Housing Prices). Study top solutions (public notebooks) to learn best practices. Kaggle's free GPU and datasets make it ideal for Indian students.</p>\n<h4>3. Your First AI Project: Indian Dataset Ideas</h4>\n<p>Good first project ideas: (1) Classify crop diseases from leaf images (PlantVillage dataset adapted for Indian crops). (2) Predict electricity demand for an Indian state using weather and seasonal data. (3) Sentiment analysis of Hindi tweets during elections. (4) House price prediction for Mumbai/Bengaluru using open property data. Start simple, measure everything, document your process.</p>\n<h4>4. Using Pre-trained Models: Hugging Face</h4>\n<p>You don't have to train from scratch. Hugging Face Hub hosts thousands of pre-trained models for NLP (IndicBERT for Indian languages), vision, and audio. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a small Indian dataset is often better than training from scratch. This approach drastically reduces compute requirements and training time.</p>\n<h4>5. Building a Portfolio and Sharing Your Work</h4>\n<p>Document every project on GitHub with a clear README. Share findings on LinkedIn — Indian AI hiring managers regularly scout GitHub and Kaggle profiles. Write about your projects on Medium or Substack. Attend AI meetups in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Hyderabad. Your portfolio is more important than your degree.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>Getting started with AI requires a development environment, a project idea with real data, and a commitment to learning by doing. Indian practitioners have access to excellent free resources: Colab, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and data.gov.in datasets. Start with a small, meaningful project, document it thoroughly, and share your work. The AI community rewards curiosity and initiative.</p>",
