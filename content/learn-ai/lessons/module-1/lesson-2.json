Its history spans more than seven decades of research, breakthroughs, disappointments, and renaissance. Understanding this history gives practitioners perspective on why current techniques work the way they do, and helps predict where the field is heading next.</p>\n<p>India has contributed to this journey too. Indian mathematicians and logicians — from Aryabhata's algorithmic thinking to C.R. Rao's foundational work in statistics — laid groundwork that underpins modern machine learning. Today, institutions like IIT, IISc, and CDAC are active contributors to global AI research.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. The Dartmouth Conference (1956) — The Birth of AI</h4>\n<p>John McCarthy coined the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" at the 1956 Dartmouth Conference, where researchers first proposed that every aspect of learning could be described so precisely that a machine could simulate it. This optimistic beginning launched decades of research into symbolic AI — rule-based systems that represented knowledge as logical propositions.</p>\n<h4>2. The First AI Winter (1974–1980)</h4>\n<p>When early AI systems failed to scale beyond toy problems, funding dried up. The inability to handle ambiguity, noise, and real-world complexity exposed the limits of purely symbolic approaches. This period, called the \"AI Winter\", taught researchers that intelligence required more than hand-crafted rules.</p>\n<h4>3. Expert Systems and the Second Wave (1980s)</h4>\n<p>Expert systems encoded domain knowledge into if-then rules, achieving commercial success in medical diagnosis (MYCIN) and financial analysis. ISRO and DRDO in India began deploying expert systems for satellite mission planning and defence applications during this period.</p>\n<h4>4. Machine Learning Renaissance (1990s–2000s)</h4>\n<p>Statistical learning methods — SVMs, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers — replaced rule-based AI. The internet generated massive datasets. Indian IT companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro) began building ML competencies to serve global clients.</p>\n<h4>5. The Deep Learning Revolution (2012–Present)</h4>\n<p>AlexNet's victory in ImageNet 2012 launched the deep learning era. GPUs made training large neural networks feasible. Today, India's AI ecosystem has grown to over 1,000 AI startups, with Bengaluru and Hyderabad as major AI hubs. NITI Aayog's National AI Strategy (2018) positioned India as a global AI leader.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>AI's history is a story of cycles: high hopes, winters of funding cuts, and eventual breakthroughs. Each wave built on the lessons of the last. The deep learning revolution of the 2010s created the AI tools you use today. India's growing AI ecosystem is part of this global story, and understanding the history helps you contribute meaningfully to what comes next.</p>",
