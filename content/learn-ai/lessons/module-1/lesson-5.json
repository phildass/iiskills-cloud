Choosing the wrong task type wastes months of effort. A common mistake is treating every problem as a classification problem when it should be formulated as a regression, ranking, or generation task.</p>\n<p>In India's diverse AI landscape, problems range from predicting monsoon crop yields (regression) to classifying disease from medical images (classification) to clustering villages by development needs (clustering). Understanding problem types is the foundation of AI problem-solving.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Classification: Categorising Inputs</h4>\n<p>Classification assigns an input to one of several discrete categories. Examples: spam vs. not-spam email, disease present vs. absent in X-ray, fraudulent vs. legitimate UPI transaction. Binary classification (two classes) and multiclass classification (many classes) are the two variants. Algorithms: logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks.</p>\n<h4>2. Regression: Predicting Continuous Values</h4>\n<p>Regression predicts a numerical output. Examples: predicting house prices in Bengaluru, forecasting rice yield per hectare in Punjab, estimating delivery time in minutes for Swiggy. The output is a real number, not a category. Algorithms: linear regression, random forest regressor, gradient boosting.</p>\n<h4>3. Clustering: Finding Hidden Groups</h4>\n<p>Clustering groups similar data points together without predefined labels. Examples: segmenting IRCTC passengers by travel behaviour, grouping Indian districts by agricultural risk profile, identifying customer segments in a retail dataset. Algorithms: K-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN.</p>\n<h4>4. Generation: Creating New Data</h4>\n<p>Generative AI creates new content — text, images, audio, code — that resembles the training data. Large Language Models (LLMs) generate text; GANs and diffusion models generate images. Applications: AI-written news summaries in regional Indian languages, synthetic medical images for model training.</p>\n<h4>5. Ranking, Recommendation, and Anomaly Detection</h4>\n<p>Ranking orders items by relevance (Google Search, Flipkart product listing). Recommendation systems suggest items a user may like (Netflix, Amazon). Anomaly detection flags outliers (insurance fraud, network intrusion). Each is a distinct task type requiring specific algorithms and evaluation metrics.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>The five core AI problem types — classification, regression, clustering, generation, and ranking/recommendation/anomaly detection — map to distinct algorithms and evaluation metrics. Correctly identifying the problem type is the first step in any AI project. Before choosing a model, always ask: \"What type of output do I need to produce?\"</p>",
