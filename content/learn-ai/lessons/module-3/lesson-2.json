Without statistical foundations, a data scientist cannot validate whether patterns are real or random noise.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Probability distributions (normal, Poisson, binomial)</h4>\n<p>Probability distributions (normal, Poisson, binomial) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Hypothesis testing and p-values</h4>\n<p>Hypothesis testing and p-values is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Correlation vs causation and sampling bias</h4>\n<p>Mastering Correlation vs causation and sampling bias separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev), Probability distributions (normal, Poisson, binomial), Hypothesis testing and p-values, and Correlation vs causation and sampling bias. These are the building blocks of statistics essentials for data science — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
