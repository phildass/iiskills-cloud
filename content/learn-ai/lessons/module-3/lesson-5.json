Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Bivariate and multivariate analysis</h4>\n<p>Bivariate and multivariate analysis forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Pandas Profiling for automated EDA</h4>\n<p>Pandas Profiling for automated EDA is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Domain-guided EDA for Indian datasets</h4>\n<p>Mastering Domain-guided EDA for Indian datasets separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Univariate analysis (histograms, box plots), Bivariate and multivariate analysis, Pandas Profiling for automated EDA, and Domain-guided EDA for Indian datasets. These are the building blocks of exploratory data analysis (eda) — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
