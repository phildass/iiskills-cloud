Well-engineered features can make a simple model beat a complex one.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Feature creation (interaction, ratio, date-time features)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Feature creation (interaction, ratio, date-time features) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Text feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings)</h4>\n<p>Text feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Target encoding and frequency encoding</h4>\n<p>Target encoding and frequency encoding is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded methods)</h4>\n<p>Mastering Feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded methods) separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Feature creation (interaction, ratio, date-time features), Text feature engineering (TF-IDF, word embeddings), Target encoding and frequency encoding, and Feature selection (filter, wrapper, embedded methods). These are the building blocks of feature engineering — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
