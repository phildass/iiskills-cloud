Python's Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly ecosystem is the global standard for data scientists.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Matplotlib: the foundation of Python visualisation</h4>\n<p>Understanding Matplotlib: the foundation of Python visualisation is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Seaborn: statistical visualisation made easy</h4>\n<p>Seaborn: statistical visualisation made easy forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Plotly: interactive web charts</h4>\n<p>Plotly: interactive web charts is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Choosing the right chart type</h4>\n<p>Mastering Choosing the right chart type separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Matplotlib: the foundation of Python visualisation, Seaborn: statistical visualisation made easy, Plotly: interactive web charts, and Choosing the right chart type. These are the building blocks of data visualisation with python \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
