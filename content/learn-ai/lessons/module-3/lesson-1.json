India has a rapidly growing data science job market with 100,000+ roles advertised in 2024.</p>\n<h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n<h4>1. Statistics and Mathematics fundamentals</h4>\n<p>Understanding Statistics and Mathematics fundamentals is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Programming and Engineering (Python, SQL)</h4>\n<p>Programming and Engineering (Python, SQL) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Domain expertise and business understanding</h4>\n<p>Domain expertise and business understanding is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. CRISP-DM workflow</h4>\n<p>Mastering CRISP-DM workflow separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>Summary</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Statistics and Mathematics fundamentals, Programming and Engineering (Python, SQL), Domain expertise and business understanding, and CRISP-DM workflow. These are the building blocks of introduction to data science \u2014 master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
