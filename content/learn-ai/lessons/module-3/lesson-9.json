India generates enormous big data volumes through UPI, Aadhaar, and mobile usage.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. The 5 Vs of Big Data</h4>\n<p>Understanding The 5 Vs of Big Data is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Apache Hadoop: distributed storage and batch processing</h4>\n<p>Apache Hadoop: distributed storage and batch processing forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Apache Spark: fast in-memory processing</h4>\n<p>Apache Spark: fast in-memory processing is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Data lakes, data warehouses, and Kafka streaming</h4>\n<p>Mastering Data lakes, data warehouses, and Kafka streaming separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered The 5 Vs of Big Data, Apache Hadoop: distributed storage and batch processing, Apache Spark: fast in-memory processing, and Data lakes, data warehouses, and Kafka streaming. These are the building blocks of big data concepts — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
