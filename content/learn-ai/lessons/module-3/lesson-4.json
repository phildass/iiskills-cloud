This transforms raw messy data into clean model-ready inputs.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Handling missing values (imputation, deletion)</h4>\n<p>Understanding Handling missing values (imputation, deletion) is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. Outlier detection (Z-score, IQR method)</h4>\n<p>Outlier detection (Z-score, IQR method) forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. Encoding categorical variables (one-hot, label encoding)</h4>\n<p>Encoding categorical variables (one-hot, label encoding) is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Feature scaling and data leakage prevention</h4>\n<p>Mastering Feature scaling and data leakage prevention separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Handling missing values (imputation, deletion), Outlier detection (Z-score, IQR method), Encoding categorical variables (one-hot, label encoding), and Feature scaling and data leakage prevention. These are the building blocks of data cleaning and preprocessing — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
