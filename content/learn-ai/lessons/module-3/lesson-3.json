India has an expanding ecosystem of open datasets across government, research, and commercial sources.</p>\n<h3>The Concept</h3>\n<h4>1. Primary vs secondary data collection</h4>\n<p>Understanding Primary vs secondary data collection is foundational to this topic. Indian companies and research institutions apply these principles in production AI systems every day.</p>\n<h4>2. data.gov.in: India's Open Government Data portal</h4>\n<p>data.gov.in: India's Open Government Data portal forms the core methodology for practitioners. India's tech ecosystem from Bengaluru to Hyderabad deploys these approaches at scale.</p>\n<h4>3. ISRO Bhuvan satellite imagery</h4>\n<p>ISRO Bhuvan satellite imagery is critical for building reliable AI solutions. Top Indian firms like TCS, Wipro, Infosys, and startups like Razorpay all leverage these techniques.</p>\n<h4>4. Web scraping and APIs</h4>\n<p>Mastering Web scraping and APIs separates good practitioners from great ones. Apply these concepts on Indian open datasets from data.gov.in to build hands-on expertise.</p>\n<h3>The Illustration</h3>\n<p>This lesson covered Primary vs secondary data collection, data.gov.in: India's Open Government Data portal, ISRO Bhuvan satellite imagery, and Web scraping and APIs. These are the building blocks of data collection and indian open datasets — master them through practice on real Indian datasets.</p>",
