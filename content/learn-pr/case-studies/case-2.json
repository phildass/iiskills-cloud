  "content": "<h2>Case Study: J&J Tylenol Crisis</h2><p>In 1982, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules in Chicago. Johnson & Johnson faced a catastrophic crisis that threatened to destroy the brand.</p><h3>Crisis Response</h3><p>J&J immediately recalled 31 million bottles of Tylenol, cooperated fully with authorities, and communicated openly with the media and public. CEO James Burke held press conferences and prioritised consumer safety over profits.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Despite the initial devastation, J&J's transparent handling of the crisis is credited with saving the brand. Tylenol recovered its market share within a year. The case set the global standard for crisis communications.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>Speed, transparency, and placing public safety above profits are the cornerstones of effective crisis communication. Never minimise or deflect when lives are at risk.</p>",
