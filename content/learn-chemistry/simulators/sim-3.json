  "instructions": "Simulate electroplating a metal object (zinc coin) with copper using a simple electrolytic cell. Apply principles of electrolysis, electrode reactions, and Faraday's laws.",
  "steps": [
    "Set up: copper sulphate (CuSO₄) electrolyte solution (0.5 mol/L), copper anode, zinc coin as cathode, 6V DC power supply.",
    "Calculate: using Faraday's law (m = MIt/nF), predict the mass of copper deposited in 10 minutes at 0.5 A.",
    "Connect the circuit. Run electrolysis for 10 minutes at 0.5 A.",
    "Disconnect, dry, and weigh the coin. Compare actual mass gain to Faraday's law prediction.",
    "Examine the anode — measure its mass loss. Compare anode mass loss to cathode mass gain.",
    "Calculate current efficiency = (actual mass / theoretical mass) × 100%."
  ],
  "expected_outcome": "The coin gains a shiny copper coating. Mass of copper deposited ≈ MIt/nF = 64×0.5×600/(2×96485) ≈ 0.10 g. Anode loses approximately equal mass.",
  "self_check_rubric": [
    "Did the zinc coin develop a visible copper coating?",
    "Is your calculated Faraday's law prediction within 20% of the actual mass gained?",
    "Did the anode lose mass approximately equal to cathode gain?",
    "Can you write the half-reactions at anode and cathode?",
    "Did you calculate current efficiency correctly?"
