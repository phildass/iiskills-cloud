  "instructions": "Given a set of unknown organic compounds, use chemical tests and physical properties to identify their functional groups and classify them. Apply organic chemistry knowledge to real identification problems.",
  "steps": [
    "Record physical properties (state, colour, odour carefully) for five unknown compounds labelled A–E.",
    "Test each with universal indicator paper — acids turn it red; measure approximate pH.",
    "Add Na₂CO₃ solution to each — carboxylic acids produce CO₂ bubbles.",
    "Add Fehling's solution and heat — aldehydes produce a brick-red precipitate (reduction of Cu²⁺).",
    "Add bromine water — alkenes decolourise it (addition reaction across C=C double bond).",
    "Compile results in a table and assign functional group to each unknown: carboxylic acid, aldehyde, alcohol, alkene, or alkane."
  ],
  "expected_outcome": "Compound A (carboxylic acid): pH<5, CO₂ with Na₂CO₃. Compound B (aldehyde): positive Fehling's test. Compound C (alcohol): neutral pH, no CO₂, no Fehling's. Compound D (alkene): decolourises bromine water. Compound E (alkane): no reactions with any reagent.",
  "self_check_rubric": [
    "Did you correctly assign all five functional groups?",
    "Did you record the observations from each test systematically?",
    "Can you write the equation for the Fehling's test reaction with an aldehyde?",
    "Did you explain why alkanes do not react with bromine water without UV light?",
    "Can you draw the structural formula for at least one compound from each class?"
