  "instructions": "Investigate how temperature affects the decomposition rate of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) using MnO₂ as a catalyst. Measure the volume of O₂ gas produced per minute at different temperatures.",
  "steps": [
    "Prepare 50 mL of 3% H₂O₂ solution. Set up a gas collection apparatus (inverted measuring cylinder over water).",
    "At 10°C (ice bath): add 0.5 g MnO₂ to H₂O₂. Record volume of O₂ collected every 30 seconds for 3 minutes.",
    "Repeat at 20°C, 30°C, 40°C, and 50°C. Keep MnO₂ mass constant.",
    "Plot volume of O₂ vs time for each temperature. Calculate initial rate (steepest gradient).",
    "Plot ln(rate) vs 1/T to determine activation energy using the Arrhenius equation.",
    "Confirm MnO₂ is unchanged at the end (weigh it) — verify it is a catalyst."
  ],
  "expected_outcome": "Rate approximately doubles for every 10°C rise. The ln(rate) vs 1/T graph is linear with slope −Eₐ/R. MnO₂ mass is unchanged, confirming catalytic behaviour.",
  "self_check_rubric": [
    "Did rate approximately double with each 10°C increase in temperature?",
    "Is your Arrhenius plot (ln k vs 1/T) linear?",
    "Is the estimated activation energy in the range 40–80 kJ/mol?",
    "Did you verify that MnO₂ mass was unchanged (confirming catalysis)?",
    "Did you control all variables except temperature throughout the experiment?"
