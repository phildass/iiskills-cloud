  "instructions": "Simulate a titration of 25.00 mL of 0.100 mol/L NaOH with 0.100 mol/L HCl. Track the pH as HCl is added from a burette. Record the volume at the equivalence point and sketch the titration curve.",
  "steps": [
    "Set up: 25.00 mL of 0.100 mol/L NaOH in a conical flask with 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator (pink in base).",
    "Fill burette with 0.100 mol/L HCl. Record the initial volume.",
    "Add HCl in 1 mL increments, swirling and recording pH after each addition.",
    "Near the equivalence point, add HCl drop-by-drop. Note the colour change from pink to colourless.",
    "Record the exact volume of HCl at the equivalence point. Plot pH vs volume of HCl added.",
    "Calculate: moles HCl at equivalence point = moles NaOH. Verify concentration of NaOH."

  "expected_outcome": "The titration curve shows a sigmoid shape with a sharp jump at pH 7 (equivalence point). Volume of HCl at equivalence point = 25.00 mL. The indicator changes from pink to colourless at the endpoint.",
  "self_check_rubric": [
    "Did the volume of HCl at equivalence point equal 25.00 mL (±0.20 mL)?",
    "Is the titration curve sigmoid-shaped with the steepest rise at pH 7?",
    "Did you identify the equivalence point correctly using the indicator colour change?",
    "Can you calculate the moles of NaOH from the volume and concentration of HCl used?",
    "Did you record at least 10 data points to accurately draw the titration curve?"
