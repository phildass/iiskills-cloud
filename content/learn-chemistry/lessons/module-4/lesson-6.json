  "content": "<h2>Module 4, Lesson 6: Ideal Gas Law</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Ideal Gas Law</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Ideal Gas Law involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Ideal Gas Law. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What does the ideal gas law combine?",
      "options": [
        "Boyle's and Graham's laws only",
        "Boyle's, Charles's, and Avogadro's laws",
        "Dalton's and Henry's laws",
        "Charles's and Gay-Lussac's laws only"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "PV = nRT combines Boyle's law (P∝1/V), Charles's law (V∝T), and Avogadro's law (V∝n)."
    },
    {
      "question": "In PV = nRT, what does 'n' represent?",
      "options": [
        "Number of atoms",
        "Number of moles of gas",
        "Pressure in pascals",
        "Temperature in Celsius"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "n is the number of moles of gas. R = 8.314 J/mol·K is the universal gas constant."
    },
    {
      "question": "At constant temperature and pressure, doubling the moles of gas will:",
      "options": [
        "Halve the volume",
        "Have no effect on volume",
        "Double the volume",
        "Quarter the volume"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Avogadro's law (part of ideal gas law): V ∝ n at constant T and P — doubling moles doubles volume."
    },
    {
      "question": "An ideal gas assumes:",
      "options": [
        "Gas molecules have significant volume and strong intermolecular forces",
        "Gas molecules have negligible volume and no intermolecular forces",
        "All collisions between molecules are inelastic",
        "Temperature has no effect on molecular motion"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The ideal gas model assumes point particles with no volume and no intermolecular attractions — real gases deviate from this especially at high pressure/low temperature."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the pressure of 2 mol of ideal gas in a 10 L container at 300 K? (R = 8.314 J/mol·K)",
      "options": [
        "0.5 atm",
        "49.9 Pa × 10³",
        "499 kPa",
        "5 atm"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "P = nRT/V = 2 × 8.314 × 300 / 10 = 498.84 ≈ 499 kPa (using SI units: L→m³ needs care, but the ratio gives ≈499 kPa)."
