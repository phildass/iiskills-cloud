  "content": "<h2>Module 6, Lesson 1: The Mole Concept</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>The Mole Concept</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> The Mole Concept involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of The Mole Concept. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

    {
      "question": "What is Avogadro's number?",
      "options": [
        "6.022 × 10²³ particles per mole",
        "6.022 × 10⁻²³ g per atom",
        "1.008 g/mol",
        "22.4 L/mol at STP"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Avogadro's number (Nₐ = 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹) is the number of particles in one mole — the bridge between atomic and laboratory scales."
    },
    {
      "question": "One mole of any ideal gas at STP occupies:",
      "options": [
        "1 litre",
        "11.2 litres",
        "22.4 litres",
        "44.8 litres"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "At STP (0°C, 1 atm), one mole of ideal gas occupies 22.4 L — the molar volume of an ideal gas at standard conditions."

    {
      "question": "What is the molar mass of water (H₂O)?",
      "options": [
        "16 g/mol",
        "18 g/mol",
        "20 g/mol",
        "10 g/mol"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "H₂O: 2(1.008) + 16.00 = 18.016 ≈ 18 g/mol."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many molecules are in 2 moles of CO₂?",
      "options": [
        "6.022 × 10²³",
        "12.044 × 10²³",
        "3.011 × 10²³",
        "1.204 × 10²³"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "2 mol × 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ = 12.044 × 10²³ = 1.2044 × 10²⁴ molecules."
    },
    {
      "question": "The mole is useful in chemistry because:",
      "options": [
        "It gives the mass of a single atom directly",
        "It connects atomic-scale particle counts to laboratory-scale masses",
        "It eliminates the need for balancing equations",
        "It only applies to gases"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The mole converts between the count of particles (atoms/molecules) and measurable mass — essential for quantitative chemistry."
