Understanding how atoms are constructed and how their components determine chemical behaviour is the essential second step in chemistry, building directly on the foundational overview introduced in Lesson 1.</p>\n      <p>The modern atomic model has evolved dramatically over the past two centuries, from Dalton's solid-sphere model through Thomson's plum-pudding model and Rutherford's nuclear model to the quantum mechanical model we use today. Each refinement was driven by experimental evidence that the previous model could not explain.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Concept</h3>\n      <h4>1. Subatomic Particles</h4>\n      <p>Three key subatomic particles define every atom: protons (positive charge, mass ≈ 1 amu, located in nucleus), neutrons (no charge, mass ≈ 1 amu, located in nucleus), and electrons (negative charge, mass ≈ 1/1836 amu, located in electron shells). The atomic number (Z) equals the number of protons; it uniquely identifies the element. The mass number (A) equals protons plus neutrons.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Isotopes and Relative Atomic Mass</h4>\n      <p>Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (and therefore different mass numbers). Carbon-12 and Carbon-14 are both carbon atoms but C-14 has two extra neutrons. The relative atomic mass on the periodic table is the weighted average of all naturally occurring isotopes. Isotopes have identical chemical properties but different nuclear properties — the basis of radiocarbon dating and nuclear medicine.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Electron Configuration</h4>\n      <p>Electrons occupy discrete energy levels (shells) described by quantum numbers. The four quantum numbers — principal (n), azimuthal (l), magnetic (ml), and spin (ms) — uniquely describe every electron in an atom. Electron configuration follows the Aufbau principle (fill lowest energy orbitals first), Hund's rule (maximise unpaired electrons in degenerate orbitals), and the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons share all four quantum numbers).</p>\n\n      <h4>4. The Quantum Mechanical Model</h4>\n      <p>Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that the precise position and momentum of an electron cannot be simultaneously known. Electron \"orbits\" are replaced by probability distributions called orbitals — regions of space where electrons are most likely to be found. s-orbitals are spherical; p-orbitals are dumbbell-shaped; d and f orbitals have more complex shapes.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Illustration</h3>\n      <p>Atomic structure determines chemical identity and behaviour. In this lesson you have examined: subatomic particles and their properties; isotopes and atomic mass; electron configuration rules; and the quantum mechanical orbital model. These concepts directly underpin chemical bonding (Lesson 3) and the organisation of the periodic table.</p>",
