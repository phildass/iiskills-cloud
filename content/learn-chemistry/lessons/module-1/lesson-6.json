Chemistry is the science of matter and its transformations, and mastering these concepts provides the foundation for understanding the world at a molecular level.</p>\n      <p>By the end of this lesson you will understand the key principles of acids and bases and be able to apply them to solve problems and analyse chemical phenomena.</p>\n\n      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n      <h4>1. Foundations of Acids and Bases</h4>\n      <p>The study of acids and bases begins with understanding the fundamental principles that govern this area of chemistry. These principles have been developed through systematic observation, experimentation, and theoretical development over centuries of scientific progress.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Core Principles and Applications</h4>\n      <p>The core principles of acids and bases can be applied to a wide range of chemical problems. Understanding these applications helps chemists design new materials, develop pharmaceuticals, improve industrial processes, and address environmental challenges.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Quantitative Aspects</h4>\n      <p>Like all branches of chemistry, acids and bases has important quantitative aspects. Numerical problem-solving skills are essential: you must be able to perform calculations, interpret data, and express results with appropriate units and significant figures.</p>\n\n      <h3>Summary</h3>\n      <p>In this lesson you have covered the key concepts of acids and bases within the context of Introduction to Chemistry. These ideas build on previous lessons and prepare you for the topics ahead. Work through the quiz to consolidate your understanding before proceeding.</p>",
