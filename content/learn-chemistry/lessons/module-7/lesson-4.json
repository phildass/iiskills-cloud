  "content": "<h2>Module 7, Lesson 4: Aromatic Compounds</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Aromatic Compounds</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Aromatic Compounds involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Aromatic Compounds. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",
  "examples": [
    "Example 1: Aromatic Compounds can be observed when matter undergoes specific transformations in controlled laboratory conditions.",
    "Example 2: In industrial applications, Aromatic Compounds principles guide the design of efficient chemical processes."

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Which statement best describes Aromatic Compounds?",
      "options": [
        "It involves only physical changes with no new substances formed",
        "It is a fundamental chemical concept explaining specific behaviour of matter",
        "It applies only to gases and has no relevance to solids",
        "It was disproved in the 20th century and is no longer used"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Aromatic Compounds is a core chemistry concept that explains specific, observable behaviour of matter."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of studying chemistry?",
      "options": [
        "To memorise the periodic table",
        "To understand the composition, structure, and transformation of matter",
        "To perform experiments without any theory",
        "To study only living organisms"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Chemistry studies matter — its composition, properties, and transformations — enabling us to explain and control the world around us."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which tool do chemists use to represent the number of particles in a substance?",
      "options": [
        "Litre",
        "Mole",
        "Kelvin",
        "Pascal"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The mole (6.022×10²³ particles) bridges atomic-scale chemistry with laboratory-scale measurements."

    {
      "question": "A student performing an experiment related to Aromatic Compounds should first:",
      "options": [
        "Begin mixing all available chemicals",
        "Read the safety data sheet and wear appropriate PPE",
        "Heat all reagents to maximum temperature",
        "Skip the procedure and guess the result"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Safety first: always read hazard information and wear PPE before any laboratory procedure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Conservation of mass in a chemical reaction means:",
      "options": [
        "Mass is lost as energy during the reaction",
        "The total mass of products equals the total mass of reactants",
        "Mass increases because new bonds form",
        "Only applies to combustion reactions"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Lavoisier's Law: atoms are rearranged in reactions — total mass is conserved because no atoms are created or destroyed."
