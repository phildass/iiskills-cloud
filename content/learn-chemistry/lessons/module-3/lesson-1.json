  "content": "<h2>Module 3, Lesson 1: Ionic Bonding</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Ionic Bonding</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Ionic Bonding involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Ionic Bonding. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

    {
      "question": "Ionic bonds form between:",
      "options": [
        "Two non-metal atoms",
        "A metal and a non-metal",
        "Two metal atoms",
        "Carbon atoms only"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ionic bonds result from electrostatic attraction between a metal cation (lost electrons) and a non-metal anion (gained electrons)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of ion does sodium form?",
      "options": [
        "Na⁻ (anion)",
        "Na⁺ (cation)",
        "Na²⁺ (cation)",
        "Na²⁻ (anion)"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Sodium (Group 1) loses 1 electron to form Na⁺, achieving a stable noble gas configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which property is characteristic of ionic compounds?",
      "options": [
        "Low melting points",
        "Good electrical conductors when solid",
        "Brittle crystalline structures with high melting points",
        "Do not dissolve in water"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Ionic compounds form crystal lattices with strong electrostatic forces — giving them high melting points and brittle (but not flexible) structures."
    },
    {
      "question": "NaCl dissolves in water because:",
      "options": [
        "NaCl is a covalent compound",
        "Water molecules (polar) attract and surround Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions",
        "NaCl reacts chemically with water",
        "Salt has lower density than water"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Polar water molecules orient around ions (O toward Na⁺, H toward Cl⁻) in hydration shells, dissociating the lattice — this is the 'like dissolves like' principle."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the octet rule?",
      "options": [
        "Atoms always have 8 neutrons",
        "Atoms tend to gain/lose/share electrons to achieve 8 valence electrons (full outer shell)",
        "Only the 8 most reactive elements form ions",
        "Groups 1–8 are the only reactive elements"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The octet rule states atoms achieve stability with 8 valence electrons (like noble gases). Hydrogen and lithium follow the 'duet rule' (2 electrons)."
