  "content": "<h2>Module 2, Lesson 3: Electron Configuration</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Electron Configuration</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Electron Configuration involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Electron Configuration. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

    {
      "question": "What rule states electrons fill the lowest available energy orbitals first?",
      "options": [
        "Pauli Exclusion Principle",
        "Hund's Rule",
        "Aufbau Principle",
        "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Aufbau principle (from German 'building up') states electrons fill orbitals starting from the lowest energy level upward."

      "question": "What is the electron configuration of sodium (Z=11)?",
      "options": [
        "1s²2s²2p⁶3s¹",
        "1s²2s²2p⁵3s²",
        "1s²2s²2p⁶",
        "1s²2s²2p⁴3s²3p¹"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "Sodium: 1s²2s²2p⁶3s¹. It has 11 electrons filled in order: 2 in 1s, 2 in 2s, 6 in 2p, 1 in 3s."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many electrons can a 2p subshell hold?",
      "options": [
        "2",
        "4",
        "6",
        "8"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A p subshell has 3 orbitals, each holding 2 electrons: 3 × 2 = 6 electrons maximum."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hund's rule states that in degenerate orbitals, electrons:",
      "options": [
        "Pair up in the same orbital before occupying separate orbitals",
        "Occupy separate orbitals singly before any pairing occurs",
        "Fill from the highest energy orbital",
        "Cannot exist with the same spin"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hund's rule maximises unpaired electrons in degenerate (equal energy) orbitals before pairing, minimising electron repulsion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are valence electrons?",
      "options": [
        "Electrons in the nucleus",
        "Electrons in the innermost shell",
        "Electrons in the outermost shell that determine chemical behaviour",
        "All electrons except the first two"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Valence electrons (outermost shell) determine how atoms bond and react — they are the key to understanding chemical properties."
