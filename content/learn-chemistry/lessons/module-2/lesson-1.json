While Module 1 introduced atoms as building blocks of matter, Module 2 examines the historical development of atomic models and the quantum theory of electrons. The progression from classical to quantum atomic models is one of the most profound conceptual revolutions in scientific history.</p>\n      <p>Understanding atomic models matters because they predict and explain chemical properties: why elements in the same group behave similarly, why some elements are metals and others non-metals, and why bonding takes the forms it does. The model is not just historical — it is the operating framework for all of modern chemistry.</p>\n\n      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n      <h4>1. Historical Development of Atomic Models</h4>\n      <p>Dalton (1808) proposed atoms as indivisible solid spheres. Thomson (1897) discovered the electron and proposed the plum-pudding model. Rutherford (1911) fired alpha particles at gold foil; most passed straight through but some deflected sharply, revealing a dense, positively charged nucleus. Bohr (1913) proposed quantised electron orbits, explaining the hydrogen emission spectrum. The quantum mechanical model (Schrödinger, 1926) replaced fixed orbits with probability-based orbitals.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Wave-Particle Duality</h4>\n      <p>De Broglie (1924) proposed that electrons have wave-like properties: λ = h/mv, where h is Planck's constant. Davisson and Germer confirmed electron diffraction experimentally in 1927. This wave-particle duality is the foundation of quantum mechanics. Electrons behave as waves when passing through a crystal lattice (diffraction pattern) and as particles when detected individually (photoelectric effect).</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Quantum Numbers and Orbital Notation</h4>\n      <p>The four quantum numbers uniquely describe each electron's state: n (principal: energy level, n = 1, 2, 3...), l (azimuthal: orbital shape, 0 to n-1), ml (magnetic: orbital orientation, -l to +l), ms (spin: +½ or -½). Electron configurations are written using spectroscopic notation: 1s²2s²2p⁶3s²3p⁶ for argon, for example. Valence electrons (outermost shell) determine chemical reactivity.</p>\n\n      <h3>Summary</h3>\n      <p>Atomic models have evolved from simple spheres to quantum probability clouds. In this lesson you have covered: the historical sequence of atomic models from Dalton to Schrödinger; wave-particle duality and its experimental basis; and quantum numbers with electron configuration notation. Module 2 continues with periodic trends, ionisation energies, and the connection between electron configuration and chemical behaviour.</p>",
