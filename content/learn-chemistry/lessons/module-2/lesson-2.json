  "content": "<h2>Module 2, Lesson 2: Subatomic Particles</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Subatomic Particles</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Subatomic Particles involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Subatomic Particles. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Which subatomic particle determines the element's identity?",
      "options": [
        "Proton",
        "Neutron",
        "Electron",
        "Nucleus"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The number of protons (atomic number Z) uniquely identifies each element."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the mass number of an atom?",
      "options": [
        "Number of protons only",
        "Number of neutrons only",
        "Number of protons plus neutrons",
        "Number of electrons"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Mass number A = protons + neutrons (both found in the nucleus)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where are electrons located in an atom?",
      "options": [
        "In the nucleus alongside protons",
        "In discrete energy levels (shells) outside the nucleus",
        "Randomly distributed throughout the atom",
        "Bonded to neutrons"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Electrons occupy energy levels (shells) surrounding the nucleus according to the quantum mechanical model."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the charge of a neutron?",
      "options": [
        "Positive (+1)",
        "Negative (−1)",
        "Zero (neutral)",
        "Variable"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Neutrons are electrically neutral — they have no charge, which is why adding neutrons creates isotopes without changing the element's chemistry."
    },
    {
      "question": "An ion is formed when an atom:",
      "options": [
        "Gains or loses protons",
        "Gains or loses electrons",
        "Changes its mass number",
        "Fuses with another atom"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ions form by electron gain (anions, negative) or loss (cations, positive) — the number of protons does not change."
