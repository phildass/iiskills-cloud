  "content": "<h2>Module 9, Lesson 2: Enthalpy Changes</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Enthalpy Changes</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Enthalpy Changes involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Enthalpy Changes. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Enthalpy (H) is defined as:",
      "options": [
        "The total kinetic energy of a system",
        "The heat content of a system at constant pressure",
        "The entropy change divided by temperature",
        "The work done by a system"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Enthalpy H = internal energy + PV work. At constant pressure, ΔH equals the heat exchanged — this is why ΔH is called the heat of reaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "A reaction with ΔH = −286 kJ/mol is:",
      "options": [
        "Endothermic — absorbs 286 kJ",
        "Exothermic — releases 286 kJ",
        "Neutral — no energy change",
        "Endothermic — releases 286 kJ"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Negative ΔH indicates exothermic reaction — energy is released to surroundings. Example: H₂ + ½O₂ → H₂O, ΔH = −286 kJ."
    },
    {
      "question": "Hess's Law states that:",
      "options": [
        "The enthalpy of a reaction depends on the pathway taken",
        "The enthalpy change of a reaction is the same regardless of the route taken",
        "Exothermic reactions always proceed faster",
        "Entropy determines the enthalpy of formation"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Hess's Law: ΔH is a state function — the total enthalpy change depends only on initial and final states, not on the intermediate steps."
    },
    {
      "question": "The standard enthalpy of formation of an element in its standard state is:",
      "options": [
        "Always positive",
        "Equal to its atomic mass",
        "Zero by definition",
        "Determined experimentally"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "By definition, the standard enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) of any element in its standard state (e.g., O₂(g), C(graphite)) is zero."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which process is endothermic?",
      "options": [
        "Combustion of propane",
        "Neutralisation of an acid with a base",
        "Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂)",
        "Rusting of iron"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Thermal decomposition requires energy input to break bonds (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂, ΔH = +178 kJ/mol) — endothermic."
