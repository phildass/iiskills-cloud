  "content": "<h2>Module 8, Lesson 1: Reaction Rates</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Reaction Rates</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Reaction Rates involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Reaction Rates. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Reaction rate is defined as:",
      "options": [
        "The temperature at which a reaction occurs",
        "The change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time",
        "The energy released in a reaction",
        "The number of moles of product formed"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Reaction rate = Δ[concentration]/Δtime (typically in mol/L·s). It describes how quickly reactants are consumed or products form."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does increasing temperature generally affect reaction rate?",
      "options": [
        "Decreases it — molecules move slower",
        "No effect on reaction rate",
        "Increases it — more particles have energy ≥ activation energy",
        "Only affects catalysed reactions"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Higher temperature increases average kinetic energy — more molecules exceed the activation energy barrier per unit time, increasing rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "The activation energy of a reaction is:",
      "options": [
        "The energy released when products form",
        "The minimum energy required for reactant molecules to successfully collide and react",
        "The energy stored in chemical bonds",
        "The temperature at which the reaction starts"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Activation energy (Eₐ) is the minimum energy barrier that colliding molecules must overcome to break bonds and form new ones."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which factor does NOT directly affect reaction rate?",
      "options": [
        "Concentration of reactants",
        "Colour of the reaction vessel",
        "Temperature",
        "Presence of a catalyst"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The colour of the reaction vessel has no direct effect on reaction rate. Concentration, temperature, surface area, and catalysts all directly influence rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "A catalyst increases reaction rate by:",
      "options": [
        "Providing energy to heat the reaction",
        "Increasing the concentration of reactants",
        "Providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy",
        "Changing the equilibrium position"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "A catalyst lowers activation energy by providing a different reaction pathway — more molecules can overcome the reduced barrier, increasing rate without being consumed."
