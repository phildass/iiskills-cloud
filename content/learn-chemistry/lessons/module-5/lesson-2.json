  "content": "<h2>Module 5, Lesson 2: Balancing Chemical Equations</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Balancing Chemical Equations</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Balancing Chemical Equations involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Balancing Chemical Equations. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What principle must be satisfied when balancing a chemical equation?",
      "options": [
        "Energy must be conserved only",
        "The number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides",
        "Products must always have more molecules than reactants",
        "Temperature must remain constant"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Balancing ensures conservation of mass — same number of each type of atom on reactant and product sides."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the balanced equation for hydrogen combustion?",
      "options": [
        "H₂ + O₂ → H₂O",
        "2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O",
        "H₂ + 2O₂ → 2H₂O",
        "4H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O: left side has 4H, 2O; right side has 4H, 2O — balanced."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does a coefficient in a balanced equation represent?",
      "options": [
        "The charge of the ion",
        "The number of moles (or molecules) of that substance",
        "The temperature required",
        "The reaction rate"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Coefficients represent molar ratios — e.g., in 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, 2 mol H₂ reacts with 1 mol O₂ to form 2 mol H₂O."
    },
    {
      "question": "When balancing equations, you may change:",
      "options": [
        "Subscripts within chemical formulas",
        "Coefficients in front of formulas",
        "The elements involved in the reaction",
        "The state symbols"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Only coefficients may be changed when balancing — changing subscripts would change the identity of the substance."

    {
      "question": "Which equation is correctly balanced?",
      "options": [
        "Fe + O₂ → FeO",
        "4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃",
        "2Fe + O₂ → FeO₂",
        "Fe₂ + O₃ → Fe₂O₃"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃: left 4Fe, 6O; right 4Fe, 6O — balanced."
