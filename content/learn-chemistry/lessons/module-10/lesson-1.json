  "content": "<h2>Module 10, Lesson 1: Electrochemistry Fundamentals</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This lesson covers <strong>Electrochemistry Fundamentals</strong>, a key topic in chemistry. Understanding this concept builds on previous lessons and prepares you for more advanced material.</p><h3>Key Concepts</h3><p><strong>Core Idea:</strong> Electrochemistry Fundamentals involves fundamental principles that explain how matter behaves at atomic and molecular levels. Scientists use these principles to predict chemical behaviour, design reactions, and develop new materials.</p><p><strong>Practical Importance:</strong> These concepts appear in industrial processes, medical applications, environmental science, and everyday products from medicines to materials.</p><p><strong>Mathematical Framework:</strong> Where applicable, relationships are expressed quantitatively, allowing precise prediction and measurement of chemical phenomena.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>You have completed the overview of Electrochemistry Fundamentals. Review the key concepts, work through the examples, complete the exercise, and pass the quiz to advance to the next lesson.</p>",

    {
      "question": "Electrochemistry studies:",
      "options": [
        "The effect of temperature on chemical reactions",
        "The relationship between electrical energy and chemical reactions",
        "The properties of noble gases",
        "The structure of atomic orbitals"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Electrochemistry examines how chemical reactions produce electricity (galvanic cells) and how electricity drives chemical reactions (electrolysis)."

    {
      "question": "In a galvanic cell, oxidation occurs at:",
      "options": [
        "The cathode",
        "The salt bridge",
        "The anode",
        "The electrolyte"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "At the anode, the oxidation half-reaction occurs — the anode loses electrons (oxidation = loss of electrons, mnemonic: OIL RIG)."

    {
      "question": "What is standard electrode potential (E°)?",
      "options": [
        "The voltage measured at 100°C",
        "The potential of an electrode measured relative to the standard hydrogen electrode under standard conditions",

        "The current produced by the cell"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "E° is measured against the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE, E° = 0.00 V) at 25°C, 1 atm, 1 mol/L concentration."
