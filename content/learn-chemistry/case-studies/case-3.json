  "scenario": "An engineering team is developing a hydrogen fuel cell for electric vehicles. They need to understand the electrochemistry and optimise efficiency.",
  "content": "<p>A hydrogen fuel cell is a galvanic cell that converts chemical energy directly to electrical energy with high efficiency. At the anode: H₂ → 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ (oxidation). At the cathode: O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O (reduction). Overall: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O, E°cell = +1.23 V.</p><p>Unlike combustion engines (~25% efficiency), fuel cells achieve 40–60% electrical efficiency. The Nernst equation describes how actual cell potential varies with hydrogen and oxygen concentrations (partial pressures).</p>",
