  "content": "<h2>Case Study: Thermochemistry of the Haber-Bosch Process</h2><p>The Haber-Bosch process is arguably the most important chemical process in human history. By synthesizing ammonia (NH₃) from atmospheric nitrogen and hydrogen, it enabled the production of nitrogen fertilizers that now feed roughly half the world's population.</p><h3>The Reaction</h3><p><strong>N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g) &nbsp; ΔH° = −92 kJ/mol</strong></p><p>The reaction is exothermic (releases heat) and involves a decrease in moles of gas (4 mol reactants → 2 mol products).</p><h3>Thermodynamic Analysis</h3><p>Using the Gibbs free energy equation ΔG° = ΔH° − TΔS°: the negative ΔH° (−92 kJ/mol) favours the forward reaction, but ΔS° is also negative (−198 J/mol·K) because gas moles decrease. At high temperatures, the −TΔS° term becomes large and positive, making ΔG° less negative — the reaction becomes less favourable thermodynamically.</p><h3>The Industrial Compromise</h3><p>Low temperatures maximize yield (Le Chatelier's principle) but slow the reaction rate unacceptably. High pressure (150–300 atm) shifts equilibrium toward NH₃. The industrial process operates at 400–500°C with an iron catalyst — a compromise that provides adequate reaction rate while maintaining reasonable equilibrium conversion (~15–25%).</p><h3>Energy Considerations</h3><p>The process is energy-intensive, consuming ~1–2% of global energy annually. Improving catalyst efficiency and exploring lower-temperature pathways remain active areas of research in green chemistry.</p>",
