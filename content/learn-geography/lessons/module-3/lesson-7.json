This lesson explores <strong>Ocean Floor and Seafloor Spreading</strong>, a key area within Oceans and Seas. Understanding this topic deepens our appreciation of the spatial patterns that shape the natural world and human societies.</p>\n      <p>Geographers examine ocean floor and seafloor spreading through multiple lenses — physical, human, and environmental — combining fieldwork, data analysis, and geospatial technologies to build a comprehensive picture of our world.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Concept</h3>\n      <h4>1. Foundations of Ocean Floor and Seafloor Spreading</h4>\n      <p>At its core, ocean floor and seafloor spreading addresses fundamental questions about how and why geographic patterns emerge. Physical processes, human decisions, and environmental feedback loops interact to produce the landscapes and systems we observe today.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Spatial Patterns and Processes</h4>\n      <p>Geographers map and analyse the distribution of phenomena related to ocean floor and seafloor spreading. Spatial analysis reveals clusters, gradients, and boundaries that reflect underlying processes. Remote sensing and GIS tools allow scientists to track changes over time at local, regional, and global scales.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Causes and Consequences</h4>\n      <p>Every geographic pattern has causes — natural, historical, or human — and consequences. In the context of oceans and seas, understanding ocean floor and seafloor spreading requires examining how processes interact across scales, from individual locations to global systems.</p>\n\n      <h4>4. Human-Environment Interactions</h4>\n      <p>Human societies both shape and are shaped by their geographic environments. Ocean Floor and Seafloor Spreading illustrates how people adapt to, modify, and sometimes degrade natural systems. Sustainable management requires understanding these interactions.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Illustration</h3>\n      <p>This lesson has introduced key ideas in <strong>Ocean Floor and Seafloor Spreading</strong> within the context of Oceans and Seas. You have explored the spatial patterns, underlying processes, and human-environment interactions that define this topic. Continue to the next lesson to build further understanding of Oceans and Seas.</p>",
