It asks two fundamental questions: \"Where?\" and \"Why there?\" By answering these questions systematically, geography illuminates the spatial patterns that structure human life — why cities grow where they do, why some regions are wealthy and others impoverished, why climate varies across the globe, and how human activity is reshaping the very planetary systems on which all life depends.</p>\n      <p>Geography bridges the natural and social sciences. Physical geography studies the Earth's natural systems — landforms, climate, soils, rivers, and ecosystems. Human geography studies the patterns of human activity — settlement, economy, culture, politics, and their spatial organisation.</p>\n      <p>This lesson introduces five foundational domains: physical geography; climate systems; human settlement and urbanisation; geopolitics; and environmental challenges.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Concept</h3>\n      <h4>1. Physical Geography: Landforms and Earth Processes</h4>\n      <p>Plate tectonics accounts for the distribution of continents, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Fluvial processes shape much of Earth's inhabited land: rivers erode upstream, transport sediment, and deposit it in fertile floodplains and deltas downstream.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Climate Systems: Patterns and Drivers</h4>\n      <p>Climate is determined by latitude, altitude, proximity to oceans, ocean currents, topography, and prevailing winds. The Köppen Climate Classification divides the world into five major zones. Ocean currents like the Gulf Stream redistribute heat globally. El Niño and La Niña disrupt normal Pacific circulation, causing droughts and floods across continents.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Human Settlement and Urbanisation</h4>\n      <p>More than 56% of the world's population now lives in cities (projected 68% by 2050). World cities function as nodes in a global network. Informal settlements house an estimated one billion people globally.</p>\n\n      <h4>4. Geopolitics and Territorial Organisation</h4>\n      <p>The world is organised into approximately 195 sovereign states. Control of strategic chokepoints influences global trade and military posture. Resource geography — the spatial distribution of oil, water, and minerals — drives foreign policy and international conflict.</p>\n\n      <h4>5. Environmental Geography</h4>\n      <p>Human geography and physical geography converge in environmental geography. Deforestation, groundwater depletion, and urban sprawl transform natural systems. Climate change — rising greenhouse gas concentrations — is the defining environmental challenge, with profoundly unequal geographic impacts.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Illustration</h3>\n      <p>Geography is the science of spatial relationships. In this lesson you have covered: physical geography and Earth processes; climate systems; urbanisation; geopolitics; and environmental geography. These foundations are the lens through which all subsequent modules will be examined.</p>",
