This lesson explores <strong>Natural Hazards</strong>, a key area within Physical Geography. Understanding this topic deepens our appreciation of the spatial patterns that shape the natural world and human societies.</p>\n      <p>Geographers examine natural hazards through multiple lenses — physical, human, and environmental — combining fieldwork, data analysis, and geospatial technologies to build a comprehensive picture of our world.</p>\n\n      <h3>Key Concepts</h3>\n      <h4>1. Foundations of Natural Hazards</h4>\n      <p>At its core, natural hazards addresses fundamental questions about how and why geographic patterns emerge. Physical processes, human decisions, and environmental feedback loops interact to produce the landscapes and systems we observe today.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Spatial Patterns and Processes</h4>\n      <p>Geographers map and analyse the distribution of phenomena related to natural hazards. Spatial analysis reveals clusters, gradients, and boundaries that reflect underlying processes. Remote sensing and GIS tools allow scientists to track changes over time at local, regional, and global scales.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Causes and Consequences</h4>\n      <p>Every geographic pattern has causes — natural, historical, or human — and consequences. In the context of physical geography, understanding natural hazards requires examining how processes interact across scales, from individual locations to global systems.</p>\n\n      <h4>4. Human-Environment Interactions</h4>\n      <p>Human societies both shape and are shaped by their geographic environments. Natural Hazards illustrates how people adapt to, modify, and sometimes degrade natural systems. Sustainable management requires understanding these interactions.</p>\n\n      <h3>Summary</h3>\n      <p>This lesson has introduced key ideas in <strong>Natural Hazards</strong> within the context of Physical Geography. You have explored the spatial patterns, underlying processes, and human-environment interactions that define this topic. Continue to the next lesson to build further understanding of Physical Geography.</p>",
