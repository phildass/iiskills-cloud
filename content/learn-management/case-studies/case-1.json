  "content": "<h2>Case Study: Tata Group Succession Planning</h2><p>The Tata Group is one of India's largest and most respected conglomerates, with operations in over 100 countries. When Ratan Tata retired in 2012, the selection of Cyrus Mistry as his successor — and Mistry's subsequent removal in 2016 — became one of the most-discussed corporate governance cases in Indian business history.</p><h3>The Succession Challenge</h3><p>Finding a successor for an iconic leader like Ratan Tata required balancing meritocracy, cultural fit, and stakeholder confidence. The Tata Sons board established a formal selection committee, the first in the group's history, to ensure a rigorous process.</p><h3>Lessons from the Mistry Episode</h3><p>The board's removal of Mistry highlighted tensions between shareholder accountability, independent board judgment, and the founder's legacy. The Supreme Court ultimately upheld Tata Sons' right to remove the chairman.</p><h3>N. Chandrasekaran's Appointment</h3><p>The appointment of N. Chandrasekaran — TCS CEO and an internal candidate — in 2017 demonstrated the value of proven track records and cultural alignment. Under his leadership, Tata Group has restructured, reduced debt, and expanded globally.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>Succession planning requires formal processes, board independence, and transparent criteria. Cultural alignment is as important as technical competence. The Tata case illustrates that even iconic organisations must build robust succession pipelines.</p>",
