  "summary": "Flipkart's rise from a two-person book-selling startup to India's leading e-commerce platform required building high-performing, motivated teams at scale during rapid hypergrowth.",
  "content": "<h2>Case Study: Flipkart Team Building</h2><p>Sachin and Binny Bansal founded Flipkart in 2007 from a Bangalore apartment. By 2014, the company was valued at $7 billion and had thousands of employees. This hypergrowth required building and maintaining organisational culture under extreme pressure.</p><h3>The Team Challenge</h3><p>Scaling from two to thousands of employees in seven years creates massive team dynamics challenges. Flipkart built cross-functional product, engineering, and operations teams that needed to collaborate on tight deadlines during the competitive festive sales season (Big Billion Days).</p><h3>Motivation Through Mission</h3><p>Flipkart's founding team maintained motivation by articulating a clear mission: democratise e-commerce for Indian consumers and make quality products accessible across India. This mission-led approach aligns with Herzberg's motivating factors of achievement and purpose.</p><h3>Managing Complexity at Scale</h3><p>As teams grew, Flipkart introduced structured performance management, OKRs, and agile development processes. The Big Billion Days (2014) — which temporarily crashed the site under demand — became a defining team learning experience.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>Rapid scaling requires intentional team culture investment. Mission clarity provides intrinsic motivation that sustains high performance. Cross-functional collaboration and psychological safety are essential during crisis periods.</p>",
