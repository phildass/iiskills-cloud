  "summary": "Yes Bank's 2020 near-collapse and subsequent RBI-managed restructuring is one of India's most instructive examples of crisis change management and organisational recovery.",
  "content": "<h2>Case Study: Yes Bank Crisis and Recovery</h2><p>Yes Bank was founded in 2003 and grew rapidly to become one of India's five largest private sector banks. However, governance failures, excessive risk-taking, and a deteriorating loan book triggered a liquidity crisis in 2020 that required RBI intervention.</p><h3>The Crisis</h3><p>By early 2020, Yes Bank had accumulated over ₹40,000 crore in bad loans and faced a deposit run as confidence collapsed. The RBI placed the bank under a moratorium and orchestrated a rescue led by SBI, with a consortium of investors injecting ₹10,000 crore.</p><h3>Change Management in Practice</h3><p>New CEO Prashant Kumar faced the challenge of rebuilding an organisation while maintaining operations. This required: communicating a compelling recovery narrative (Kotter Step 4), stabilising the leadership team, and implementing structural changes to governance and risk management.</p><h3>Recovery Strategy</h3><p>Yes Bank's recovery focused on reducing bad loans, rebuilding deposits through customer trust campaigns, tightening credit underwriting standards, and strengthening the board and governance processes. By 2022, the bank returned to profitability.</p><h3>Key Learnings</h3><p>Crisis change management requires decisive action, transparent communication, and visible quick wins. The Yes Bank case illustrates how governance failures create change management crises — and how structured change models (Kotter, Lewin) can guide recovery in the most challenging circumstances.</p>",
