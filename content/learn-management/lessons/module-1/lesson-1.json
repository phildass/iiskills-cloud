  "content": "<h2>Module 1, Lesson 1: Foundations of Business Management</h2>\n\n      <h3>The Hook</h3>\n      <p>Management is the discipline of getting things done through people. At its core, management is the process of planning, organising, leading, and controlling resources — human, financial, technological, and informational — to achieve organisational goals efficiently and effectively. Every business, government agency, non-profit, and even family operates through some form of management.</p>\n      <p>The study of management has evolved from the purely mechanistic scientific management of Frederick Taylor to today's humanistic, adaptive approaches that recognise people as the primary source of competitive advantage.</p>\n      <p>This lesson covers the four core management functions, leadership theory, organisational behaviour, strategic planning, and performance management — the five pillars that every effective manager must master.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Concept</h3>\n      <h4>1. The Four Core Functions of Management</h4>\n      <p><strong>Planning</strong> defines objectives and selects strategies. <strong>Organising</strong> designs the structure for executing work. <strong>Leading</strong> motivates and directs people. <strong>Controlling</strong> monitors performance and takes corrective action.</p>\n\n      <h4>2. Leadership Theory and Practice</h4>\n      <p>Trait theory identifies characteristics of effective leaders. Situational Leadership (Hersey and Blanchard) adapts style to follower readiness. Transformational Leadership — inspiring followers to transcend self-interest for the collective good — is consistently associated with highest organisational performance.</p>\n\n      <h4>3. Organisational Behaviour</h4>\n      <p>Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, and Vroom's Expectancy Theory explain motivation. Tuckman's team development model (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing) guides team management.</p>\n\n      <h4>4. Strategic Planning</h4>\n      <p>PESTEL analysis examines the macro-environment. Porter's Five Forces analyses industry competition. SWOT analysis integrates internal and external factors. Porter's three generic strategies (Cost Leadership, Differentiation, Focus) guide competitive positioning.</p>\n\n      <h4>5. Performance Management</h4>\n      <p>The Balanced Scorecard measures performance across Financial, Customer, Internal Processes, and Learning perspectives. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) provide a flexible goal-setting framework used by high-performing organisations.</p>\n\n      <h3>The Illustration</h3>\n      <p>Management is the practice of achieving goals through people and systems. In this lesson you have covered: the four management functions; leadership theory; organisational behaviour and motivation; strategic planning; and performance management frameworks. These foundations support every topic in this course.</p>",
