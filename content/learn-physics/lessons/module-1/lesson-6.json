  "content": "<h2>Projectile Motion</h2><h3>The Hook</h3><p>When a cricket fielder throws the ball back to the wicketkeeper, the ball traces a curved path through the air. Why does it curve? This beautiful arc is called <strong>projectile motion</strong>!</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p>A projectile is any object thrown into the air that moves under gravity alone (no engine). Its motion is a combination of two independent motions: <strong>horizontal</strong> (constant velocity) and <strong>vertical</strong> (constant acceleration downward due to gravity, g ≈ 10 m/s²). The result is a curved path called a <em>parabola</em>.</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>Imagine tossing a tiffin box horizontally off a table. Horizontally, it travels at constant speed. Vertically, it falls faster and faster. Both happen simultaneously, creating the curve. A javelin athlete, a basketball player, or the legendary Sachin hitting a six — all rely on projectile physics to perfect their technique!</p>",
