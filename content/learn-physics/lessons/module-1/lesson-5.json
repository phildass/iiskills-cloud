They use the <strong>equations of motion</strong> — three simple formulas that describe any object moving with constant acceleration!</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p>The three equations of motion are: (1) <strong>v = u + at</strong>, (2) <strong>s = ut + ½at²</strong>, (3) <strong>v² = u² + 2as</strong>. Here u = initial velocity, v = final velocity, a = acceleration, t = time, s = displacement. These only work when acceleration is constant (uniform).</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>A cyclist starts from rest (u=0) and accelerates at 2 m/s² for 5 seconds. Using v = u + at: v = 0 + 2×5 = <strong>10 m/s</strong>. Distance covered: s = 0×5 + ½×2×25 = <strong>25 m</strong>. These same equations help engineers design safe stopping distances for Chennai's metro trains!</p>",
