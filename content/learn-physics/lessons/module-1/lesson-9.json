  "content": "<h2>Momentum and Impulse</h2><h3>The Hook</h3><p>Why does a cricket ball hurt more when caught at high speed than when it barely reaches the fielder? The answer lies in <strong>momentum</strong> — the quantity of motion an object carries!</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p><strong>Momentum</strong> (p) = mass × velocity (p = mv). SI unit: kg·m/s. The greater the mass or velocity, the greater the momentum. <strong>Impulse</strong> = Force × Time = Change in momentum (J = FΔt = Δp). <strong>Law of Conservation of Momentum</strong>: In a closed system with no external forces, total momentum before = total momentum after a collision.</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>A cricket batsman follows through after hitting the ball — this increases contact time, which reduces the average force (impulse = same, but spread over longer time). Crumple zones in cars work the same way. Two billiard balls colliding: total momentum before = total momentum after. Even India's Chandrayaan missions use momentum conservation for orbital manoeuvres!</p>",
