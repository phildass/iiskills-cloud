They all multiply force to make work easier!</p><h3>💡 The Simple Core</h3><p>A <strong>simple machine</strong> is a device that changes the magnitude or direction of a force. Six types: lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, wedge, screw. Key concept: <strong>Mechanical Advantage</strong> (MA) = Load ÷ Effort. MA > 1 means you apply less force to lift more. But energy is conserved — you gain force but lose distance (or vice versa). Efficiency = (useful output work ÷ input work) × 100%.</p><h3>🎯 The Show</h3><p>A lever (like a see-saw or a crowbar) uses a fulcrum. Placing the fulcrum near the load gives high MA — the dhobi uses a wooden stick as a lever to wring clothes. An inclined plane (ramp) lets you move a heavy gas cylinder onto a truck without lifting it straight up. Pulleys are used in construction cranes across Indian cities!</p>",
