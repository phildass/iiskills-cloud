Your body experiences <strong>acceleration</strong> and <strong>deceleration</strong> every day!</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p><strong>Acceleration</strong> is the rate of change of velocity. Formula: a = (v − u) ÷ t, where v is final velocity, u is initial velocity, and t is time. If velocity increases, acceleration is positive. If velocity decreases, it is called <strong>deceleration</strong> (negative acceleration). The SI unit of acceleration is m/s².</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>A cricket ball is bowled at 0 m/s and reaches 30 m/s in 0.5 s. Acceleration = (30−0)÷0.5 = <strong>60 m/s²</strong>. When your father brakes the car from 60 km/h to 0 in 5 seconds, the car is decelerating. Lorry drivers on NH highways must manage acceleration carefully to save fuel!</p>",
