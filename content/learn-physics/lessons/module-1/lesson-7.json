Because in <strong>circular motion</strong>, the direction keeps changing — and changing direction means changing velocity — which means acceleration!</p><h3>💡 The Simple Core</h3><p>In uniform circular motion, speed is constant but velocity changes direction continuously. This requires a <strong>centripetal force</strong> directed towards the centre of the circle. Formula: F = mv²/r, where m is mass, v is speed, r is radius. Examples: Earth orbiting the Sun, a bike turning a corner, a stone tied to a string swung in a circle.</p><h3>🎯 The Show</h3><p>When you swing a stone tied to a string, the string provides the centripetal force pulling the stone inward. If the string breaks, the stone flies off in a straight line (tangent). On India's highway curves, banked roads are designed so that vehicles can safely turn using the component of the normal force as centripetal force — this is why mountain roads are tilted!</p>",
