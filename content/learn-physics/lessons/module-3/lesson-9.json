  "content": "<h2>Solar and Wind Energy</h2><h3>🔥 The Spark</h3><p>Did you know that the physics of <strong>solar and wind energy</strong> is at work all around you — even in a simple cricket ball? In this lesson we uncover the science behind it.</p><h3>💡 The Simple Core</h3><p><strong>Solar and Wind Energy</strong> is a fundamental topic in Work and Energy. Understanding it helps explain everyday phenomena and forms the basis of many engineering applications. The key idea is that physical quantities follow predictable mathematical relationships that scientists have verified through careful experiments in labs just like your school lab.</p><h3>🎯 The Show</h3><p>Consider a cricket ball: the physics of <strong>solar and wind energy</strong> governs its behaviour directly. Engineers and scientists across India — from ISRO scientists in Bengaluru to factory engineers in Pune — apply these principles daily. By mastering this concept, you are building the same mental toolkit they use. Practice the five quiz questions below to test your understanding!</p>",
