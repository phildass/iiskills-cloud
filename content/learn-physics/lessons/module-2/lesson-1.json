  "content": "<h2>Newton's First Law — Inertia</h2><h3>The Hook</h3><p>Did you know that the physics of <strong>newton's first law — inertia</strong> is at work all around you — even in a simple kite flying? In this lesson we uncover the science behind it.</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p><strong>Newton's First Law — Inertia</strong> is a fundamental topic in Newton's Laws. Understanding it helps explain everyday phenomena and forms the basis of many engineering applications. The key idea is that physical quantities follow predictable mathematical relationships that scientists have verified through careful experiments in labs just like your school lab.</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>Consider a kite flying: the physics of <strong>newton's first law — inertia</strong> governs its behaviour directly. Engineers and scientists across India — from ISRO scientists in Bengaluru to factory engineers in Pune — apply these principles daily. By mastering this concept, you are building the same mental toolkit they use. Practice the five quiz questions below to test your understanding!</p>",
