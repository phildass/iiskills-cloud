India operates several nuclear power stations — and they produce electricity without burning coal or releasing CO₂!</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p>A <strong>nuclear power plant</strong> uses controlled fission of uranium-235 or plutonium-239 to produce heat. This heat converts water into steam, which drives a turbine connected to a generator. The key components are: the reactor core (where fission happens), control rods (absorb neutrons to regulate the reaction), coolant (water or heavy water), and the steam turbine-generator.</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>India's nuclear power programme is led by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL). Key plants include Tarapur (Maharashtra), Rawatbhata (Rajasthan), Kudankulam (Tamil Nadu), and Kaiga (Karnataka). Together they produce about 7,000 MW of electricity — enough to power millions of homes. The Kudankulam plant, built with Russian collaboration, uses modern VVER pressurised water reactors.</p>",
