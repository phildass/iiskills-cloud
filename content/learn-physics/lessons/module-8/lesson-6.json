This is <strong>nuclear fusion</strong>!</p><h3>💡 The Simple Core</h3><p><strong>Nuclear fusion</strong> is the process of combining two light atomic nuclei (like hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium) to form a heavier nucleus, releasing enormous energy. This is the opposite of fission. Fusion releases even more energy per unit mass than fission, and produces no long-lived radioactive waste. The fuel (hydrogen isotopes) is found in seawater — nearly unlimited supply!</p><h3>🎯 The Show</h3><p>The Sun fuses about 620 million tonnes of hydrogen every second, converting about 4 million tonnes into pure energy (E=mc²). The temperature required is over 15 million °C — hotter than anything on Earth. Scientists at ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) in France are building the world's largest fusion reactor. India is a partner in ITER through its nuclear research programmes!</p>",
