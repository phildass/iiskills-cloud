Understanding radiation safety is essential for medical workers, nuclear plant employees, and anyone working with radioactive materials.</p><h3>The Concept</h3><p><strong>Ionising radiation</strong> (alpha, beta, gamma, X-rays) can damage living cells and DNA. The unit of absorbed radiation dose is the <strong>Gray (Gy)</strong>; the unit of biological effect is the <strong>Sievert (Sv)</strong>. Protection follows three principles: <em>Time</em> (minimise exposure time), <em>Distance</em> (radiation intensity decreases with distance squared — inverse square law), and <em>Shielding</em> (lead blocks gamma; paper blocks alpha; aluminium blocks beta).</p><h3>The Illustration</h3><p>In a hospital radiology department in India, the radiographer stands behind a lead-glass screen while taking X-rays — this reduces their annual dose to safe limits. Nuclear plant workers wear dosimeter badges that measure cumulative radiation exposure. International guidelines (ICRP) set the safe limit at 20 mSv per year for radiation workers. Background radiation in India averages about 2.4 mSv/year — from cosmic rays, soil, and radon gas.</p>",
